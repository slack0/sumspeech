Good afternoon, everybody. Today, I want to start by addressing three 
issues, and then I'll take your questions.

First, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Iran. The United 
States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by 
the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days. I 
strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people 
in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.

I've made it clear that the United States respects the sovereignty of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, and is not interfering with Iran's affairs. But 
we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the Iranian 
people, and to a remarkable opening within Iranian society. And we deplore 
the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.

The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in 
Iran -- some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid 
that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of 
instigating protests over the election. These accusations are patently 
false. They're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly 
taking place within Iran's borders. This tired strategy of using old 
tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in Iran. This is 
not about the United States or the West; this is about the people of Iran, 
and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose.

The Iranian people can speak for themselves. That's precisely what's 
happened in the last few days. In 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to 
shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice. 
Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate 
itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us 
through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the Iranian 
people are doing.

This is what we've witnessed. We've seen the timeless dignity of tens of 
thousands of Iranians marching in silence. We've seen people of all ages 
risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their 
voices are heard. Above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the 
brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman 
bleeding to death on the streets. While this loss is raw and 
extraordinarily painful, we also know this: Those who stand up for justice 
are always on the right side of history.

As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go 
away. The Iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free 
speech. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international 
community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own 
people. It must govern through consent and not coercion. That's what Iran's 
own people are calling for, and the Iranian people will ultimately judge 
the actions of their own government.

Now, the second issue I want to address is our ongoing effort to build a 
clean energy economy.

This week, the House of Representatives is moving ahead on historic 
legislation that will transform the way we produce and use energy in 
America. This legislation will spark a clean energy transformation that 
will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and confront the carbon pollution 
that threatens our planet.

This energy bill will create a set of incentives that will spur the 
development of new sources of energy, including wind, solar, and geothermal 
power. It will also spur new energy savings, like efficient windows and 
other materials that reduce heating costs in the winter and cooling costs 
in the summer.

These incentives will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of 
energy. And that will lead to the development of new technologies that lead 
to new industries that could create millions of new jobs in America -- jobs 
that can't be shipped overseas.

At a time of great fiscal challenges, this legislation is paid for by the 
polluters who currently emit the dangerous carbon emissions that 
contaminate the water we drink and pollute the air that we breathe. It also 
provides assistance to businesses and communities as they make the gradual 
transition to clean energy technologies.

So I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important for our 
country; it's taken great effort on the part of many over the course of the 
past several months. And I want to thank the Chair of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, Henry Waxman; his colleagues on that committee, 
including Congressmen Dingell, Ed Markey, and Rick Boucher. I also want to 
thank Charlie Rangel, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, and Collin 
Peterson, the Chair of the Agriculture Committee, for their many and 
ongoing contributions to this process. And I want to express my 
appreciation to Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer for their leadership.

We all know why this is so important. The nation that leads in the creation 
of a clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the 21st century's 
global economy. That's what this legislation seeks to achieve -- it's a 
bill that will open the door to a better future for this nation. And that's 
why I urge members of Congress to come together and pass it.

The last issue I'd like to address is health care.

Right now, Congress is debating various health care reform proposals. This 
is obviously a complicated issue, but I am very optimistic about the 
progress that they're making.

Like energy, this is legislation that must and will be paid for. It will 
not add to our deficits over the next decade. We will find the money 
through savings and efficiencies within the health care system -- some of 
which we've already announced.

We will also ensure that the reform we pass brings down the crushing cost 
of health care. We simply can't have a system where we throw good money 
after bad habits. We need to control the skyrocketing costs that are 
driving families, businesses, and our government into greater and greater 
debt.

There's no doubt that we must preserve what's best about our health care 
system, and that means allowing Americans who like their doctors and their 
health care plans to keep them. But unless we fix what's broken in our 
current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Unless we act, 
premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, and the rolls of 
the uninsured will swell to include millions more Americans. Unless we act, 
one out of every five dollars that we earn will be spent on health care 
within a decade. And the amount our government spends on Medicare and 
Medicaid will eventually grow larger than what our government spends on 
everything else today.

When it comes to health care, the status quo is unsustainable and 
unacceptable. So reform is not a luxury, it's a necessity. And I hope that 
Congress will continue to make significant progress on this issue in the 
weeks ahead.

So let me open it up for questions, and I'll start with you, Jennifer.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. Your administration has said that the offer to 
talk to Iran's leaders remains open. Can you say if that's still so, even 
with all the violence that has been committed by the government against the 
peaceful protesters? And if it is, is there any red line that your 
administration won't cross where that offer will be shut off?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, obviously what's happened in Iran is profound. And 
we're still waiting to see how it plays itself out. My position coming into 
this office has been that the United States has core national security 
interests in making sure that Iran doesn't possess a nuclear weapon and it 
stops exporting terrorism outside of its borders.

We have provided a path whereby Iran can reach out to the international 
community, engage, and become a part of international norms. It is up to 
them to make a decision as to whether they choose that path. What we've 
been seeing over the last several days, the last couple of weeks, obviously 
is not encouraging, in terms of the path that this regime may choose to 
take. And the fact that they are now in the midst of an extraordinary 
debate taking place in Iran may end up coloring how they respond to the 
international community as a whole.

We are going to monitor and see how this plays itself out before we make 
any judgments about how we proceed. But just to reiterate, there is a path 
available to Iran in which their sovereignty is respected, their 
traditions, their culture, their faith is respected, but one in which they 
are part of a larger community that has responsibilities and operates 
according to norms and international rules that are universal. We don't 
know how they're going to respond yet, and that's what we're waiting to 
see.

Q So should there be consequences for what's happened so far?

THE PRESIDENT: I think that the international community is, as I said 
before, bearing witness to what's taking place. And the Iranian government 
should understand that how they handle the dissent within their own 
country, generated indigenously, internally, from the Iranian people, will 
help shape the tone not only for Iran's future but also its relationship to 
other countries.

Since we're on Iran, I know Nico Pitney is here from Huffington Post.

Q Thank you, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: Nico, I know that you, and all across the Internet, we've 
been seeing a lot of reports coming directly out of Iran. I know that there 
may actually be questions from people in Iran who are communicating through 
the Internet. Do you have a question?

Q Yes, I did, I wanted to use this opportunity to ask you a question 
directly from an Iranian. We solicited questions last night from people who 
are still courageous enough to be communicating online, and one of them 
wanted to ask you this: Under which conditions would you accept the 
election of Ahmadinejad? And if you do accept it without any significant 
changes in the conditions there, isn't that a betrayal of what the 
demonstrators there are working towards?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, we didn't have international observers on the 
ground. We can't say definitively what exactly happened at polling places 
throughout the country. What we know is that a sizeable percentage of the 
Iranian people themselves, spanning Iranian society, consider this election 
illegitimate. It's not an isolated instance -- a little grumbling here or 
there. There is significant questions about the legitimacy of the election.

And so ultimately the most important thing for the Iranian government to 
consider is legitimacy in the eyes of its own people, not in the eyes of 
the United States. And that's why I've been very clear: Ultimately, this is 
up to the Iranian people to decide who their leadership is going to be and 
the structure of their government.

What we can do is to say unequivocally that there are sets of international 
norms and principles about violence, about dealing with peaceful dissent, 
that spans cultures, spans borders. And what we've been seeing over the 
Internet and what we've been seeing in news reports violates those norms 
and violates those principles.

I think it is not too late for the Iranian government to recognize that 
there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and legitimacy and 
prosperity for the Iranian people. We hope they take it.

Jeff Mason of Reuters.

Q Right here, sir. Switching gears slightly, in light of the financial 
regulation and reform that you have made, how do you rate the performance 
of the Fed in handling the financial crisis? And more specifically, how do 
you rate the performance of Ben Bernanke, and would you like him to stay on 
when his term ends in January?

THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to make news about Ben Bernanke -- (laughter) 
-- although I think he has done a fine job under very difficult 
circumstances.

I would say that all financial regulators didn't do everything that needed 
to be done to prevent the crisis from happening. And that's why we've put 
forward the boldest set of reforms in financial regulation in 75 years, 
because there were too many gaps where there were laws on the books that 
would have brought about a prevention of the crisis; the enforcement wasn't 
there. In some cases, there just weren't sufficient laws on the books -- 
for example, with the non-banking sector.

I think that the Fed probably performed better than most other regulators 
prior to the crisis taking place, but I think they'd be the first to 
acknowledge that in dealing with systemic risk and anticipating systemic 
risk, they didn't do everything that needed to be done.

I think since the crisis has occurred, Ben Bernanke has performed very 
well. And one of the central concepts behind our financial regulatory 
reform is that there's got to be somebody who is responsible not just for 
monitoring the health of individual institutions, but somebody who's 
monitoring the systemic risks of the system as a whole. And we believe that 
the Fed has the most technical expertise and the best track record in terms 
of doing that.

But that's not the only part of financial regulation. One of the things 
that we're putting a huge amount of emphasis on is the issue of consumer 
protection -- whether it's subprime loans that were given out because 
nobody was paying attention to what was being peddled to consumers, whether 
it's how credit cards are handled, how annuities are dealt with, what 
people can expect in terms of understanding their 401(k)s. There's a whole 
bunch of financial transactions out there where consumers are not protected 
the way they should, and that's why we said we're going to put forward a 
consumer financial protection agency whose only job it is to focus on those 
issues.

Now, the Fed was one of the regulators that had some of those consumer 
responsibilities. We actually think that they're better off focusing on 
issues of broad systemic risk, and we have just one agency that's focused 
on the consumer protection side.

Q But is the Fed getting too powerful?

THE PRESIDENT: If you look at what we've proposed, we are not so much 
expanding the Fed's power as we are focusing what the Fed needs to do to 
prevent the kinds of crises that are happening again. Another good example 
is the issue of resolution authority. I think it wasn't that long ago where 
everybody was properly outraged about AIG, and the enormous amounts of 
money the taxpayers had to put into AIG in order to prevent it from 
dragging the entire financial system down with it.

Had we had the kinds of resolution authority, the kinds of laws that were 
in place that would allow a orderly winding down of AIG, then potentially 
taxpayers could have saved a huge amount of money. We want that power to be 
available so that taxpayers aren't on the hook.

All right? Major Garrett. Where's Major?

Q Right here, sir. In your opening remarks, sir, you were -- you said about 
Iran that you were appalled and outraged. What took you so long to say 
those words?

THE PRESIDENT: I don't think that's accurate. Track what I've been saying. 
Right after the election, I said that we had profound concerns about the 
nature of the election, but that it was not up to us to determine what the 
outcome was. As soon as violence broke out -- in fact, in anticipation of 
potential violence -- we were very clear in saying that violence was 
unacceptable, that that was not how governments operate with respect to 
their people.

So we've been entirely consistent, Major, in terms of how we've approached 
this. My role has been to say the United States is not going to be a foil 
for the Iranian government to try to blame what's happening on the streets 
of Tehran on the CIA or on the White House; that this is an issue that is 
led by and given voice to the frustrations of the Iranian people. And so 
we've been very consistent the first day, and we're going to continue to be 
consistent in saying this is not an issue about the United States; this is 
about an issue of the Iranian people.

What we've also been consistent about is saying that there are some 
universal principles, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, 
making sure that governments are not using coercion and violence and 
repression in terms of how they interact with peaceful demonstrators. And 
we have been speaking out very clearly about that fact.

Q Are Iranian diplomats still welcome at the embassy on the Fourth of July, 
sir?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think as you're aware, Major, we don't have formal 
diplomatic relations with -- we don't have formal diplomatic relations with 
Iran. I think that we have said that if Iran chooses a path that abides by 
international norms and principles, then we are interested in healing some 
of the wounds of 30 years, in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations. But that is 
a choice that the Iranians are going to have to make.

Q But the offer still stands?

THE PRESIDENT: That's a choice the Iranians are going to have to make.

David Jackson.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. Two of the key players in the insurance 
industry, America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross-Blue Shield, sent 
a letter to the Senate this morning saying that a government health 
insurance plan would "dismantle" private insurers. Why are they wrong? And 
secondly, this public plan, is this non-negotiable? Would you sign a health 
care bill without it?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's talk first of all about health care reform more 
broadly.

I think in this debate there's been some notion that if we just stand pat 
we're okay. And that's just not true. You know, there are polls out that 
show that 70 or 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with the health 
insurance that they currently have. The only problem is that premiums have 
been doubling every nine years, going up three times faster than wages. The 
U.S. government is not going to be able to afford Medicare and Medicaid on 
its current trajectory. Businesses are having to make very tough decisions 
about whether we drop coverage or we further restrict coverage.

So the notion that somehow we can just keep on doing what we're doing and 
that's okay, that's just not true. We have a longstanding critical problem 
in our health care system that is pulling down our economy, it's burdening 
families, it's burdening businesses, and it is the primary driver of our 
federal deficits. All right?

So if we start from the premise that the status quo is unacceptable, then 
that means we're going to have to bring about some serious changes. What 
I've said is, our top priority has to be to control costs. And that means 
not just tinkering around the edges. It doesn't mean just lopping off 
reimbursements for doctors in any given year because we're trying to fix 
our budget. It means that we look at the kinds of incentives that exist, 
what our delivery system is like, why it is that some communities are 
spending 30 percent less than other communities but getting better health 
care outcomes, and figuring out how can we make sure that everybody is 
benefiting from lower costs and better quality by improving practices. It 
means health IT. It means prevention.

So all these things are the starting point, I think, for reform. And I've 
said very clearly: If any bill arrives from Congress that is not 
controlling costs, that's not a bill I can support. It's going to have to 
control costs. It's going to have to be paid for. So there's been a lot of 
talk about, well, a trillion-dollar price tag. What I've said is, if we're 
going to spend that much money, then it's going to be largely funded 
through reallocating dollars that are already in the health care system but 
aren't being spent well. If we're spending $177 billion over 10 years to 
subsidize insurance companies under Medicare Advantage, when there's no 
showing that people are healthier using that program than the regular 
Medicare program, well, that's not a good deal for taxpayers. And we're 
going to take that money and we're going to use it to provide better care 
at a cheaper cost to the American people. So that's point number one.

Number two, while we are in the process of dealing with the cost issue, I 
think it's also wise policy and the right thing to do to start providing 
coverage for people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured, 
are paying a lot of money for high deductibles. I get letters -- two, three 
letters a day -- that I read of families who don't have health insurance, 
are going bankrupt, are on the brink of losing their insurance; have 
deductibles that are so high that even with insurance they end up with 
$50,000, $100,000 worth of debt; are at risk of losing their homes.

And that has to be part of reform, making sure that even if you've got 
health insurance now, you are not worried that when you lose your job or 
your employer decides to change policies that somehow you're going to be 
out of luck. I think about the woman who was in Wisconsin that I was with, 
who introduced me up in Green Bay -- 36 years old, double mastectomy; 
breast cancer has now moved to her bones and she's got two little kids, a 
husband with a job. They had health insurance, but they're still $50,000 in 
debt, and she's thinking, my main legacy, if I don't survive this thing, is 
going to be leaving $100,000 worth of debt. So those are the things that 
I'm prioritizing.

Now, the public plan I think is a important tool to discipline insurance 
companies. What we've said is, under our proposal, let's have a system the 
same way that federal employees do, same way that members of Congress do, 
where -- we call it an "exchange," or you can call it a "marketplace" -- 
where essentially you've got a whole bunch of different plans. If you like 
your plan and you like your doctor, you won't have to do a thing. You keep 
your plan. You keep your doctor. If your employer is providing you good 
health insurance, terrific, we're not going to mess with it.

But if you're a small business person, if the insurance that's being 
offered is something you can't afford, if you want to shop for a better 
price, then you can go to this exchange, this marketplace, and you can 
look: Okay, this is how much this plan costs, this is how much that plan 
costs, this is what the coverage is like, this is what fits for my family. 
As one of those options, for us to be able to say, here's a public option 
that's not profit-driven, that can keep down administrative costs and that 
provides you good, quality care for a reasonable price -- as one of the 
options for you to choose, I think that makes sense.

Q Won't that drive private insurers out of business?

THE PRESIDENT: Why would it drive private insurers out of business? If 
private insurers say that the marketplace provides the best quality health 
care, if they tell us that they're offering a good deal, then why is it 
that the government -- which they say can't run anything -- suddenly is 
going to drive them out of business? That's not logical.

Now, I think that there's going to be some healthy debates in Congress 
about the shape that this takes. I think there can be some legitimate 
concerns on the part of private insurers that if any public plan is simply 
being subsidized by taxpayers endlessly, that over time they can't compete 
with the government just printing money.

So there are going to be some I think legitimate debates to be had about 
how this private plan takes shape. But just conceptually, the notion that 
all these insurance companies who say they're giving consumers the best 
possible deal, that they can't compete against a public plan as one option, 
with consumers making the decision what's the best deal. That defies logic, 
which is why I think you've seen in the polling data overwhelming support 
for a public plan. All right?

Q Is that non-negotiable?

THE PRESIDENT: Chip.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. Following up on Major's question, some 
republicans on Capitol Hill -- John McCain and Lindsey Graham, for example 
-- have said that up to this point, your response on Iran has been timid 
and weak. Today, it sounded a lot stronger. It sounded like the kind of 
speech John McCain has been urging you to give, saying that those who stand 
up for justice are always on the right side of history, referring to an 
iron fist in Iran -- "deplore," "appalled," "outraged." Were you influenced 
at all by John McCain and Lindsey Graham accusing you of being timid and 
weak?

THE PRESIDENT: What do you think? Look, the -- I think John McCain has 
genuine passion about many of these international issues, and I think that 
all of us share a belief that we want justice to prevail. But only I'm the 
President of the United States, and I've got responsibilities in making 
certain that we are continually advancing our national security interests 
and that we are not used as a tool to be exploited by other countries.

I mean, you guys must have seen the reports. They've got some of the 
comments that I've made being mistranslated in Iran, suggesting that I'm 
telling rioters to go out and riot some more. There are reports suggesting 
that the CIA is behind all this -- all of which are patently false. But it 
gives you a sense of the narrative that the Iranian government would love 
to play into. So the -- members of Congress, they've got their 
constitutional duties, and I'm sure they will carry them out in the way 
that they think is appropriate. I'm President of the United States, and 
I'll carry out my duties as I think are appropriate. All right?

Q By speaking so strongly today, aren't you giving the leadership in Iran 
the fodder to make those arguments that it is about the United States?

THE PRESIDENT: Look, I mean, I think that -- we can parse this as much as 
we want. I think if you look at the statements that I've made, they've been 
very consistent. I just made a statement on Saturday in which we said we 
deplore the violence. And so I think that in the hothouse of Washington, 
there may be all kinds of stuff going back and forth in terms of Republican 
critics versus the administration. That's not what is relevant to the 
Iranian people. What's relevant to them right now is, are they going to 
have their voices heard?

And, frankly, a lot of them aren't paying a lot of attention to what's 
being said on Capitol Hill, and probably aren't spending a lot of time 
thinking about what's being said here. They're trying to figure out how can 
they make sure justice is served in Iran.

Q So there's no news in your statement today?

THE PRESIDENT: Chuck Todd.

Q Mr. President, I want to follow up on Iran. You have avoided twice 
spelling out consequences. You've hinted that there would be, from the 
international community, if they continue to violate -- you said violate 
these norms. You seem to hint that there are human rights violations taking 
place./

THE PRESIDENT: I'm not hinting. I think that when a young woman gets shot 
on the street when she gets out of her car, that's a problem.

Q Then why won't you spell out the consequences that the Iranian --

THE PRESIDENT: Because I think, Chuck, that we don't know yet how this 
thing is going to play out. I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news 
cycle. I'm not.

Q But shouldn't -- I mean, shouldn't the world and Iran --

THE PRESIDENT: Chuck, I answered --

Q -- but shouldn't the Iranian regime know that there are consequences?

THE PRESIDENT: I answered the question, Chuck, which is that we don't yet 
know how this is going to play out.

Jake Tapper.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. Before I ask my question, I'm wondering if you 
could actually answer David's. Is the public plan non-negotiable?

THE PRESIDENT: That's your question.

Q Well, you didn't answer --

THE PRESIDENT: You think you're going to -- are you the ombudsman for the 
White House press corps? What's your -- is that your question?

Q Then I have a two-part question. Is the public plan non-negotiable? And 
while I appreciate your Spock-like language about the logic of the health 
care plan, the public plan, it does seem logical to a lot of people that if 
the government is offering a cheaper health care plan, then lots of 
employers will want to have their employees covered by that cheaper plan, 
which will not have to be for profit, unlike private plans, and may 
possibly benefit from some government subsidies, who knows. And then their 
employees would be signed up for this public plan, which would violate what 
you're promising the American people, that they will not have to change 
health care plans if they like the plan they have.

THE PRESIDENT: I got you. You're pitching, I'm catching. I got the 
question. First of all, was the reference to Spock -- is that a crack on my 
ears? All right, I just want to make sure. No?

Q I would never make fun of your ears, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: In answer to David's question, which you co-opted, we are 
still early in this process, so we have not drawn lines in the sand other 
than that reform has to control costs and that it has to provide relief to 
people who don't have health insurance or are underinsured. Those are the 
broad parameters that we've discussed.

There are a whole host of other issues where ultimately I may have a strong 
opinion, and I will express those to members of Congress as this is shaping 
up. It's too early to say that. Right now I will say that our position is 
that a public plan makes sense.

Now, let me go to the broader question you made about the public plan. As I 
said before, I think that there is a legitimate concern if the public plan 
was simply eating off the taxpayer trough, that it would be hard for 
private insurers to complete. If, on the other hand, the public plan is 
structured in such a way where they've got to collect premiums and they've 
got to provide good services, then if what the insurance companies are 
saying is true, that they're doing their best to serve their customers, 
that they're in the business of keeping people well and giving them 
security when they get sick, they should be able to compete.

Now, if it turns out that the public plan, for example, is able to reduce 
administrative costs significantly, then you know what? I'd like insurance 
companies to take note and say, hey, if the public plan can do that, why 
can't we? And that's good for everybody in the system. And I don't think 
there should be any objection to that.

Now, by the way, I should point out that part of the reform that we've 
suggested is that if you want to be a private insurer as part of the 
exchange, as part of this marketplace, this menu of options that people can 
choose from, we're going to have some different rules for all insurance 
companies -- one of them being that you can't preclude people from getting 
health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, you can't cherry pick 
and just take the healthiest people.

So there are going to be some ground rules that are going to apply to all 
insurance companies, because I think the American people understand that, 
too often, insurance companies have been spending more time thinking about 
how to take premiums and then avoid providing people coverage than they 
have been thinking about how can we make sure that insurance is there, 
health care is there when families need it.

But I'm confident that if -- I take those advocates of the free market to 
heart when they say that the free market is innovative and is going to 
compete on service and is going to compete on their ability to deliver good 
care to families. And if that's the case then this just becomes one more 
option. If it's not the case then I think that that's something that the 
American people should know.

Q I'm sorry, but what about keeping your promise to the American people 
that they won't have to change plans even if employers --

THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, no, I mean -- when I say if you have your plan and 
you like it and your doctor has a plan, or you have a doctor and you like 
your doctor that you don't have to change plans, what I'm saying is the 
government is not going to make you change plans under health reform.

Now, are there going to be employers right now -- assuming we don't do 
anything -- let's say that we take the advice of some folks who are out 
there and say, oh, this is not the time to do health care, we can't afford 
it, it's too complicated, let's take our time, et cetera. So let's assume 
that nothing happened. I can guarantee you that there's a possibility for a 
whole lot of Americans out there that they're not going to end up having 
the same health care they have, because what's going to happen is, as costs 
keep on going up, employers are going to start making decisions: We've got 
to raise premiums on our employees; in some cases, we can't provide health 
insurance at all.

And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's 
exactly why health reform is so important.

Margaret, from McClatchy. Where's Margaret? There you are.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. As a former smoker, I understand the 
frustration and the fear that comes with quitting. But with the new law 
that you signed yesterday regulating the tobacco industry, I'd like to ask 
you a few questions. How many cigarettes a day --

THE PRESIDENT: A few questions?

Q How many cigarettes a day do you now smoke? Do you smoke alone or in the 
presence of other people? And do you believe the new law would help you to 
quit? If so, why?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the new law that was put in place is not 
about me, it's about the next generation of kids coming up. So I think it's 
fair, Margaret, to just say that you just think it's neat to ask me about 
my smoking, as opposed to it being relevant to my new law. (Laughter.) But 
that's fine, I understand. It's an interesting human -- it's an interesting 
human interest story.

But I've said before that, as a former smoker, I constantly struggle with 
it. Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a 
constant smoker? No. I don't do it in front of my kids, I don't do it in 
front of my family, and I would say that I am 95 percent cured, but there 
are times where -- (laughter) -- there are times where I mess up. And, I 
mean, I've said this before. I get this question about once every month or 
so, and I don't know what to tell you, other than the fact that, like folks 
who go to AA, once you've gone down this path, then it's something you 
continually struggle with, which is precisely why the legislation we signed 
was so important, because what we don't want is kids going down that path 
in the first place. Okay?

Macarena Vidal?

Q Mr. President, you're meeting today with Chilean President Michelle 
Bachelet. You're meeting next week with Alvaro Uribe from Colombia. Two 
months ago in Trinidad at the Summit of the Americas, you said that -- you 
called on Latin American countries to help you with deeds, not words, 
particularly towards less democratic countries. Have you noticed any 
particular progress in these two months, and can you give us examples?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I'm very much looking forward to seeing 
President Bachelet. I think she's one of the finest leaders in Latin 
America, a very capable person. If you look at how Chile has handled the 
recession, they've handled it very well in part because the surpluses that 
they got when copper prices were high they set aside. And so they had the 
resources to deal with the downturn. It's a good lesson for the United 
States. When we had surpluses, they got dissipated.

We think that there's enormous possibilities of making progress in Latin 
America generally. One of the things that I'll be talking about with 
President Bachelet is the coordination and cooperation between the United 
State and Chile on clean energy. We'll have an announcement when we do our 
press conference after my bilateral meeting on some important clean energy 
partnerships. We're making important progress when it comes to exchanges on 
cancer research. We continue to have a robust trade regime with Chile. And, 
by the way, Chile has actually entered into some very interesting 
partnerships not just with the federal government, but also with state 
governments like California.

So I think the relationship that we have with Chile -- which, by the way, 
does not fall in line with U.S. foreign policy on every single issue -- but 
it's a respectful policy. Chile is an important partner. I think that's the 
model that we want: partnership. The United States doesn't dictate how 
Chile should view its own interests, but in fact we've achieved great 
cooperation. And I will be looking at President Bachelet giving us further 
advice in terms of how we can take the kind of relationship we have with 
Chile and expand that to our relationships throughout Latin America.

Q But my question is not only about that -- Chile, but about Latin American 
countries giving you a hand on -- against less democratic countries.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, the point is, is that I think Chile is leading by 
example. So I'm using Chile as an example. But the same is true in Brazil, 
for example. I mean, President Lula came in, and he's got a very different 
political orientation than most Americans do. He came up through the trade 
union movement. He was perceived as a strong leftist. It turns out that he 
was a very practical person, who although maintains relationships across 
the political spectrum in Latin America, has instituted all sorts of smart 
market reforms that have made Brazil prosper.

And so if you take a Bachelet or a Lula, and the United States has a good 
working relationship with them, then I think that points the way for other 
countries that may be where the democratic tradition is not as deeply 
embedded as we'd like it to be. And we can make common cause in showing 
those countries that, in fact, democracy, respect for property rights, 
respects for market-based economies, rule of law -- that all those things 
can in fact lead to greater prosperity, that that's not just a U.S. agenda, 
but that's a smart way to increase the prosperity of your own people.

Okay, Hans Nichols. Hans.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. If I can just return to the economy more 
generally. When you were selling the economic stimulus package, you talked 
and your advisors and economists talked about keeping unemployment below 8 
percent. Last week you acknowledged that unemployment is likely to reach 
double digits, being 10 percent. Do you think you need a second stimulus 
package?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, not yet, because I think it's important to see how the 
economy evolves and how effective the first stimulus is. I think it's fair 
to say that -- keep in mind the stimulus package was the first thing we 
did, and we did it a couple of weeks after inauguration. At that point 
nobody understood what the depths of this recession were going to look 
like. If you recall, it was only significantly later that we suddenly get a 
report that the economy had tanked.

And so it's not surprising then that we missed the mark in terms of our 
estimates of where unemployment would go. I think it's pretty clear now 
that unemployment will end up going over 10 percent, if you just look at 
the pattern, because of the fact that even after employers and businesses 
start investing again and start hiring again, typically it takes a while 
for that employment number to catch up with economic recovery. And we're 
still not at actual recovery yet.

So I anticipate that this is going to be a difficult -- difficult year, a 
difficult period.

Q What's the high water mark, then, for unemployment? Eleven percent?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm not suggesting that I have a crystal ball. Since 
you just threw back at us our last prognosis, let's not -- let's not engage 
in another one.

Q Does that mean you won't be making predictions ever?

THE PRESIDENT: But what I am saying is that -- here are some things I know 
for certain. In the absence of the stimulus, I think our recession would be 
much worse. It would have declined -- without the Recovery Act -- we know 
for a fact that states, for example, would have laid off a lot more 
teachers, a lot more police officers, a lot more firefighters, every single 
one of those individuals whose jobs were saved. As a consequence, they are 
still making their mortgage payments, they are still shopping. So we know 
that the Recovery Act has had an impact.

Now, what we also know is this was the worst recession since the Great 
Depression, and people are going through a very tough time right now. And I 
don't expect them to be satisfied. I mean, one thing that -- as I sometimes 
glance at the various news outlets represented here, I know that they're 
sometimes reporting of, oh, the administration is worried about this, or 
their poll numbers are going down there -- look, the American people have a 
right to feel like this is a tough time right now. What's incredible to me 
is how resilient the American people have been and how they are still more 
optimistic than the facts alone would justify, because this is a tough, 
tough period.

And I don't feel satisfied with the progress that we've made. We've got to 
get our Recovery Act money out faster. We've got to make sure that the 
programs that we've put in place are working the way they're supposed to. I 
think, for example, our mortgage program has actually helped to modify 
mortgages for a lot of people, but it hasn't been keeping pace with all the 
foreclosures that are taking place. I get letters every day from people who 
say, you know, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the 
bank is still not letting me modify my mortgage and I'm about to lose my 
home. And then I've got to call my staff and team and find out why isn't it 
working for these folks, and can we adjust it, can we tweak it, can we make 
it more aggressive?

This is a very, very difficult process. And what I've got to do is to make 
sure that we're focused both on the short term, how can we provide families 
immediate relief and jumpstart the economy as quickly as possible; and I've 
got to keep my eye on the long term, and the long term is making sure that 
by reforming our health care system, by passing serious energy legislation 
that makes us a clean energy economy, by revamping our education system, by 
finally getting the financial regulatory reforms in place that are 
necessary for the 21st century -- by doing all those things, we've got a 
foundation for long-term economic growth, and we don't end up having to 
juice up the economy artificially through the kinds of bubble strategies 
that helped to get us in the situation that we're in today.

Okay. I've got time for two more questions. April. Where's April?

Q Right here.

THE PRESIDENT: There you are. How are you?

Q I'm fine. Back on the economy, Mr. President, people are criticizing this 
road to recovery plan. Specifically, there are reports in The Washington 
Post that say that the African America unemployment rate will go to 20 
percent by the end of this year. And then you had your Chairman of Economic 
Advisers say the target intervention may come next year if nothing changes. 
Why not target intervention now to stop the bloodletting in the black 
unemployment rate?

THE PRESIDENT: Look, first of all, we know that the African American 
unemployment rate, the Latino unemployment rate, are consistently higher 
than the national average. And so, if the economy as a whole is doing 
poorly, then you know that the African American community is going to be 
doing poorly, and they're going to be hit even harder. And the best thing 
that I can do for the African American community or the Latino community or 
the Asian community, whatever community, is to get the economy as a whole 
moving. If I don't -- hold on one second, let me answer the question -- if 
I don't do that, then I'm not going to be able to help anybody. So that's 
priority number one.

It is true that in certain inner-city communities, the unemployment rate is 
-- was already sky high even before this recession. The ladders available 
for people to enter into the job market are even worse. And so we are 
interested in looking at proven programs that help people on a pathway to 
jobs.

There was a reason why right before Father's Day I went to a program here 
locally in Washington called Year Up, which has a proven track record of 
taking young, mostly minority people, some of whom have graduated from high 
school, some maybe who've just gotten their GED, and trained them on 
computers and provide them other technical skills, but also train them on 
how to carry themselves in an office, how to write an e-mail -- some of the 
social skills that will allow them to be more employable. They've got a 
terrific placement rate after this one-year program. If there are ways that 
we can potentially duplicate some of those programs, then we're going to do 
so.

So part of what we want to do is to find tools that will give people more 
opportunity, but the most important thing I can do is to lift the economy 
overall. And that's what my strategy is focused on.

All right. Last question. Suzanne.

Q Thank you. Back to Iran, putting a human face on this. Over the weekend, 
we saw a shocking video of this woman, Neda, who had been shot in the chest 
and bled to death. Have you seen this video?

THE PRESIDENT: I have.

Q What's your reaction?

THE PRESIDENT: It's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. And I think that 
anybody who sees it knows that there's something fundamentally unjust about 
that.

Q We also have people on the ground who have been saying that the streets 
are quieter now and that is because they feel that they're paralyzed by 
fear -- fear of people gone missing, fear of violence, that perhaps this is 
a movement that's gone underground or perhaps is dying. Do you have any 
concern over that?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I have concern about how peaceful demonstrators and 
people who want their votes counted may be stifled from expressing those 
concerns. I think, as I said before, there are certain international norms 
of freedom of speech, freedom of expression --

Q Then why won't you allow the photos --

THE PRESIDENT: Hold on a second, Helen. That's a different question. And I 
think it's important for us to make sure that we let the Iranian people 
know that we are watching what's happening, that they are not alone in this 
process. Ultimately, though, what's going to be most important is what 
happens in Iran. And we've all been struck by the courage of people. And I 
mentioned this I think in a statement that I made a couple of days ago. 
Some of you who had been covering my campaigns know this is one of my 
favorite expressions, was Dr. King's expression that "the arc of the moral 
universe is long, but it bends towards justice." We have to believe that 
ultimately justice will prevail.

All right. Thank you, guys.
