Hello, hello, hello! Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat. 
Thank you. Hello, Pittsburgh! It is good to be back. Thank you, Senator 
Casey, and Mayor Ravenstahl, County Executive Dan Onorato, State Auditor 
Jack Wagner, and all of you for having me back here at Carnegie Mellon. It 
is good to be here.

And it seems like every time I'm here I learn something. So, for those of 
you who are thinking about Carnegie Mellon
 , it's a terrific 
place, and you guys are doing just great work.

I just met with folks from some cutting-edge companies and saw some of 
their inventions here in your National Robotics Engineering Center
 . But that’s not the only reason I’m here. You 
might not know this, but one of my responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief 
is to keep an eye on robots. And I’m pleased to report that the robots you 
manufacture here seem peaceful -- at least for now.

This is a city that knows something about manufacturing. For generations of 
Americans, it was the ticket to a middle-class life. Here and across 
America's industrial heartland, millions clocked in each day at foundries 
and on assembly lines to make things. And the stuff we made -- steel, cars, 
planes -- was the stuff that made America what it is. The jobs were good. 
They paid enough to own a home, to raise kids, send them to college, to 
retire. They were jobs that told us something more important than just how 
much money we made, what was in our paycheck. These jobs also told us that 
we were meeting our responsibilities to our family and to our 
neighborhoods, and building our communities, and building our country.

But for better and worse, our generation has been pounded by wave after 
wave of profound economic change. Revolutions in technology have 
transformed the way we live and the way we work. Businesses and industries 
can relocate anywhere in the world, anywhere that there are skilled 
workers, anywhere that there is an Internet connection. And companies have 
learned to become more efficient with fewer employees. In Pittsburgh, you 
know this as well as anybody -- steel mills that once needed a thousand 
workers now do the same work with a hundred.

And while these changes have resulted in great wealth for some Americans 
and have drastically increased productivity, they’ve also caused major 
disruptions for many others. Today, a high school diploma no longer 
guarantees you a job. Over the past 13 years, about a third of our 
manufacturing jobs have vanished. And meanwhile, the typical worker’s wages 
have barely kept up with the rising costs of everything else. And all this 
was even before a financial crisis and recession that pounded the middle 
class even more.

Now, we’ve made some tough decisions that have turned our economy in a 
positive direction over the past two years. We’ve created more than 2 
million new jobs in the private sector over the past 15 months alone, 
including almost 250,000 in manufacturing. But we still have to confront 
those underlying problems. They weren’t caused overnight, and we won’t 
solve them overnight. But we will solve them. And we’re starting to solve 
them right here in Pittsburgh, and right here at Carnegie Mellon.

And by the way, that’s why I ran for President. Not just to get us back to 
where we were -- I ran for President to get us to where we need to be. I 
have a larger vision for America -- one where working families feel secure, 
feel like they are moving forward and that they know that their dreams are 
within reach; an America where our businesses lead the world in new 
technologies like clean energy; where we work together, Democrats and 
Republicans, to live within our means, to cut our deficit and debt, but 
also to invest in what our economy needs to grow -- world-class education, 
cutting-edge research, and building the best transportation and 
communication infrastructure anywhere in the world. That’s what it’s going 
to take for us to win the future. And winning the future begins with 
getting our economy moving right now.

And that’s why we’re here. Carnegie Mellon is a great example of what it 
means to move forward. At its founding, no one would have imagined that a 
trade school for the sons and daughters of steelworkers would one day 
become the region’s largest -- one of the region’s largest employers and a 
global research university. And yet, innovations led by your professors and 
your students have created more than 300 companies and 9,000 jobs over the 
past 15 years -- companies like Carnegie Robotics.

But more important than the ideas that you’ve incubated are what those 
ideas have become: They’ve become products made right here in America and, 
in many cases, sold all over the world. And that's in our blood. That's who 
we are. We are inventors, and we are makers, and we are doers.  

If we want a robust, growing economy, we need a robust, growing 
manufacturing sector. That’s why we told the auto industry two years ago 
that if they were willing to adapt, we’d stand by them. Today, they’re 
profitable, they’re creating jobs, and they’re repaying taxpayers ahead of 
schedule.

That's why we’ve launched a partnership to retrain workers with new skills. 
That’s why we’ve invested in clean energy manufacturing and new jobs 
building wind turbines and solar panels and advanced batteries. We have not 
run out of stuff to make. We’ve just got to reinvigorate our manufacturing 
sector so that it leads the world the way it always has -- from paper and 
steel and cars to new products that we haven’t even dreamed up yet. That’s 
how we’re going to strengthen existing industries; that's how we’re going 
to spark new ones. That’s how we’re going to create jobs, grow the middle 
class, and secure our economic leadership.

And this is why I asked my Council of Advisors on Science and Technology
 -- what we call 
PCAST -- a while back to look at the state of American manufacturing and 
the promise of advanced manufacturing. The concept of advanced 
manufacturing is not complicated. It means how do we do things better, 
faster, cheaper to design and manufacture superior products that allow us 
to compete all over the world.

And so these very smart folks, many of whom are represented here, wrote up 
a report which is now up on the White House website. But we didn't want to 
just issue a report, we wanted to actually get something done. So we’ve 
launched an all-hands-on-deck effort between our brightest academic minds, 
some of our boldest business leaders, and our most dedicated public 
servants from science and technology agencies, all with one big goal, and 
that is a renaissance of American manufacturing.

We’re calling it AMP, A-M-P -- the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. It’s 
made up of some of the most advanced engineering universities, like 
Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan; some of our 
most innovative manufacturers, from Johnson & Johnson to Honeywell, Stryker 
to Allegheny Technologies. I’ve asked Susan Hockfield, the President of 
MIT, who is here -- there’s Susan -- and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow 
Chemical -- to lead this partnership, and to work with my own advisors on 
science, technology and manufacturing.

Throughout our history, our greatest breakthroughs have often come from 
partnerships just like this one. American innovation has always been 
sparked by individual scientists and entrepreneurs, often at universities 
like Carnegie Mellon or Georgia Tech or Berkeley or Stanford. But a lot of 
companies don’t invest in early ideas because it won’t pay off right away. 
And that’s where government can step in. That’s how we ended up with some 
of the world-changing innovations that fueled our growth and prosperity and 
created countless jobs -- the mobile phone, the Internet, GPS, more than 
150 drugs and vaccines over the last 40 years was all because we were able 
to, in strategic ways, bring people together and make some critical 
investments.

I’ll take one example. The National Science Foundation helped fund 
Stanford’s Digital Library Project  in 
the 1990s. The idea was to develop a universal digital library that anybody 
could access. So two enterprising Ph.D. students got excited about the 
research that was being done at Stanford -- this is funded by NSF. So these 
two Ph.D. students, they moved from campus to a friend’s garage, and they 
launched this company called Google  
. And when the private sector runs with the ball, it then leads to jobs, 
building and selling, that is successful all over the world.  

This new partnership that we’ve created will make sure tomorrow’s 
breakthroughs are American breakthroughs. We’re teaming up to foster the 
kind of collaborative R&D that resulted in those same early discoveries, 
and to create the kind of innovation infrastructure necessary to get ideas 
from the drawing board to the manufacturing floor to the market more 
rapidly -- all of which will make our businesses more competitive and 
create new, high-quality manufacturing jobs.

Now, to help businesses operate at less cost, the Energy Department will 
develop new manufacturing processes and materials that use half as much 
energy. That will free up more money for companies to hire new workers or 
buy new equipment.

To help businesses discover, develop, and deploy new materials twice as 
fast, we’re launching what we call the Materials Genome Initiative
 
. The invention of silicon circuits and lithium-ion batteries made 
computers and iPods and iPads possible -- but it took years to get those 
technologies from the drawing board to the marketplace. We can do it 
faster.

To help everyone from factory workers to astronauts carry out more 
complicated tasks, NASA and other agencies will support research into 
next-generation robotics. And I just met with folks from a local company, 
RedZone Robotics  , who make robots that explore 
water and sewer pipes. And I have to say, it is fascinating stuff, when you 
watch -- the robot is about this big. It can go through any sewer system. 
It’s operated remotely by the municipal worker. It’s got a camera attached 
so it can film everything that it’s seeing. It then transmits the data. It 
goes into a citywide database, and can enhance the productivity of these 
workers by three or fourfold, and help the city make even better decisions. 
Potentially this can save cities millions in infrastructure costs. 
Companies also are training new workers to operate the robots, and analysts 
to pore through the data that’s being collected.

To help smaller manufacturers compete, federal agencies are working with 
private companies to make powerful, often unaffordable modeling and 
simulation software easier to access. And I just saw an example. A few 
years ago, Procter & Gamble teamed up with the researchers at Los Alamos 
National Labs to adapt software developed for war to figure out what’s 
happening with nuclear particles, and they are using these simulators to 
dramatically boost the performance of diapers. Yes, diapers. Folks chuckle, 
but those who’ve been parents -- are always on the lookout for 
indestructible, military-grade diapers.

But here’s what’s remarkable: Using this simulation software that was 
developed at Los Alamos, Procter & Gamble has saved 500 million dollars -- 
half a billion dollars -- as a consequence of this simulator. Now, through 
the new partnership that we’re setting up, Procter & Gamble is offering its 
powerful fluid dynamics simulator to smaller manufacturers, and it’s doing 
it for free.  

Now, this is not just because Procter & Gamble wants to do good. It’s also 
they’ve got thousands of suppliers, and they're thinking to themselves, if 
we can apply this simulation technology to our smaller suppliers they're 
going to be able to make their products cheaper and better, then that, in 
turn, is going to save us even more money. And it has a ripple effect 
throughout the economy.

Starting this summer, federal agencies will partner with industries to 
boost manufacturing in areas critical to our national security.  I just saw 
an example backstage. The Defense Department scientists -- we call it 
DARPA  -- the folks who brought us stealth 
technology and, by the way, who brought us the Internet -- wanted to see if 
it was possible to design defense systems cheaper and faster. So they found 
a small company in Arizona called Local Motors
 , and they gave them a test:  You have one 
month to design a new combat support vehicle, and you’ve got three months 
to build it.

Their CEO, Jay Rogers, is here today, and as an ex-Marine who lost a couple 
of buddies in combat, understood the importance of increasing the speed and 
adaptability and flexibility of our manufacturing process for vehicles that 
are used in theater.

So Local Motors solicited design ideas on their website, chose the best out 
of 162 that it received, built and brought this new vehicle here ahead of 
schedule. We just took a look at it. Not only could this change the way the 
government uses your tax dollars -- because think about it, instead of 
having a 10-year lead time to develop a piece of equipment with all kinds 
of changing specs and a moving target, if we were able to collapse the pace 
at which that manufacturing takes place, that could save taxpayers billions 
of dollars. But it also could get products out to theater faster, which 
could save lives more quickly, and could then be used to transfer into the 
private sector more rapidly, which means we could get better products and 
services that we can sell and export around the world. So it’s good for 
American companies. It’s good for American jobs. It’s good for taxpayers. 
And it may save some lives in places like Afghanistan for our soldiers.

So that’s what this is all about. As futuristic and, let’s face it, as cool 
as some of this stuff is, as much as we are planning for America’s future, 
this partnership is about new, cutting-edge ideas to create new jobs, spark 
new breakthroughs, reinvigorate American manufacturing today. Right now. 
Not somewhere off in the future -- right now.  

It’s about making sure our workers and businesses have the skills and the 
tools they need to compete better, faster, and smarter than anybody else. 
That's what we’re about. We are America, and we don’t just keep up with 
changing times, we set the pace for changing times. We adapt; we innovate; 
we lead the way forward.

It’s worth remembering, there was a time when steel was about as advanced 
as manufacturing got. But when the namesake of this university, Andrew 
Carnegie  -- an immigrant, by 
the way -- discovered new ways to mass-produce steel cheaply, everything 
changed. Just 20 years after founding his company, not only was it the 
largest, most profitable in the world, America had become the number one 
steelmaker in the world.  

Now, imagine if America was first to develop and mass-produce a new 
treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched; or 
solar cells you can brush onto a house for the same cost as paint; or 
flexible display soldiers -- flexible displays that soldiers can wear on 
their arms; or a car that drives itself. Imagine how many workers and 
businesses and consumers would prosper from those breakthroughs.  

Those things aren’t science fiction -- they’re real. They’re being 
developed and deployed in labs and factories and on test tracks right now. 
They sprang from the imagination of students and scientists and 
entrepreneurs like all of you. And the purpose of this partnership is to 
prove that the United States of America has your back, is going to be 
supporting you -- because that’s the kind of adventurous, pioneering spirit 
that we need right now.

That’s the spirit that’s given us the tools and toughness to overcome every 
obstacle and adapt to every circumstance. And if we remember that spirit, 
if we combine our creativity, our innovation, and our optimism, if we come 
together in common cause, as we've done so many times before, then we will 
thrive again. We will get to where we need to be. And we will make this 
century the American century just like the last one was.  

Thank you very much, everybody.

God bless you.

And God bless the United States of America.
