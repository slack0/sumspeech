</font>
			<p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Speaker, Madam 
			Deputy Speaker, distinguished members, I am honored to speak in this 
			chamber, and I am committed to renewing the alliance between our 
			nations and the friendship between our people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is my first trip 
			overseas as President of the United States. I've been to the G20 
			summit in London, and the NATO summit in Strasbourg, and the 
			European Union summit in Prague. Some people have asked me if I 
			chose to continue my travels to Ankara and Istanbul to send a 
			message to the world. And my answer is simple: Evet -- yes. 
			Turkey is a critical ally. Turkey is an important part 
			of Europe. And Turkey and the United States must stand together -- 
			and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This morning I had the 
			great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder 
			of your republic. And I was deeply impressed by this beautiful 
			memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history. 
			But it is also clear that the greatest monument to Ataturk's life is 
			not something that can be cast in stone and marble. His greatest 
			legacy is Turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is 
			the work that this assembly carries on today.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This future was not 
			easily assured, it was not guaranteed. At the end of World War I, 
			Turkey could have succumbed to the foreign powers that were trying 
			to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancient empire. But 
			Turkey chose a different future. You freed yourself from foreign 
			control, and you founded a republic that commands the respect of the 
			United States and the wider world.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And there is a simple 
			truth to this story: Turkey's democracy is your own achievement. It 
			was not forced upon you by any outside power, nor did it come 
			without struggle and sacrifice. Turkey draws strength from both the 
			successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of 
			Turks that makes new progress for your people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, my country's 
			democracy has its own story. The general who led America in 
			revolution and governed as our first President was, as many of you 
			know, George Washington. And like you, we built a grand monument to 
			honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the 
			heart of the capital city that bears Washington's name. I can see 
			the Washington Monument from the window of the White House every 
			day.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It took decades to 
			build. There were frequent delays. Over time, more and more people 
			contributed to help make this monument the inspiring structure that 
			still stands tall today. Among those who came to our aid were 
			friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to 
			Washington and the country he helped to found.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And one of those 
			tributes came from Istanbul. Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid sent a marble 
			plaque that helped to build the Washington Monument. Inscribed in 
			the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words: &quot;So as to 
			strengthen the friendship between the two countries.&quot; Over 150 years 
			have passed since those words were carved into marble. Our nations 
			have changed in many ways. But our friendship is strong, and our 
			alliance endures.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a friendship that 
			flourished in the years after World War II, when President Truman 
			committed our nation to the defense of Turkey's freedom and 
			sovereignty, and Turkey committed itself into the NATO Alliance. 
			Turkish troops have served by our side from Korea to Kosovo to 
			Kabul. Together, we withstood the great test of the Cold War. Trade 
			between our nations has steadily advanced. So has cooperation in 
			science and research.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The ties among our 
			people have deepened, as well, and more and more Americans of 
			Turkish origin live and work and succeed within our borders. And as 
			a basketball fan, I've even noticed that Hedo Turkoglu and Mehmet 
			Okur have got some pretty good basketball games.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States and 
			Turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be 
			expected -- no two nations do. But we have stood together through 
			many challenges over the last 60 years. And because of the strength 
			of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both America 
			and Turkey are stronger and the world is more secure.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, our two democracies 
			are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: An economic 
			crisis that recognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the 
			killing of innocent men and women and children; strains on our 
			energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the 
			world's deadliest weapons; and the persistence of tragic conflict.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the great 
			tests of our young century. And the choices that we make in the 
			coming years will determine whether the future will be shaped by 
			fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife or by a 
			just, secure and lasting peace.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This much is certain: No 
			one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have 
			a stake in overcoming them. That is why we must listen to one 
			another, and seek common ground. That is why we must build on our 
			mutual interests, and rise above our differences. We are stronger 
			when we act together. That is the message that I've carried with me 
			throughout this trip to Europe. That is the message that I delivered 
			when I had the privilege of meeting with your President and with 
			your Prime Minister. That will be the approach of the United States 
			of America going forward.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Already, America and 
			Turkey are working with the G20 on an unprecedented response to an 
			unprecedented economic crisis. Now, this past week, we came together 
			to ensure that the world's largest economies take strong and 
			coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of 
			credit; to reject the pressures of protectionism, and to extend a 
			hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this 
			downturn; and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that 
			the world never faces a crisis like this again.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we go forward, the 
			United States and Turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve 
			prosperity for our people. The President and I this morning talked 
			about expanding the ties of commerce and trade. There's enormous 
			opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs. And we can 
			increase new sources to not only free ourselves from dependence of 
			other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to 
			combat climate change. We should build on our Clean Technology Fund 
			to leverage efficiency and renewable energy investments in Turkey. 
			And to power markets in Turkey and Europe, the United States will 
			continue to support your central role as an East-West corridor for 
			oil and natural gas.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This economic 
			cooperation only reinforces the common security that Europe and the 
			United States share with Turkey as a NATO ally, and the common 
			values that we share as democracies. So in meeting the challenges of 
			the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a Europe that is 
			truly united, peaceful and free.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me be clear: The 
			United States strongly supports Turkey's bid to become a member of 
			the European Union. We speak not as members of the EU, 
			but as close friends of both Turkey and Europe. Turkey has been a 
			resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and 
			European institutions. Turkey is bound to Europe by more than the 
			bridges over the Bosphorous. Centuries of shared history, culture, 
			and commerce bring you together. Europe gains by the diversity of 
			ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it. And 
			Turkish membership would broaden and strengthen Europe's foundation 
			once more.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, of course, Turkey 
			has its own responsibilities. And you've made important progress 
			towards membership. But I also know that Turkey has pursued 
			difficult political reforms not simply because it's good for EU 
			membership, but because it's right for Turkey.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last several 
			years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the 
			right to counsel. You've reformed the penal code and strengthened 
			laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly. You've 
			lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting Kurdish, and the world 
			noted with respect the important signal sent through a new state 
			Kurdish television station.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These achievements have 
			created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that 
			should be sustained. For democracies cannot be static -- they must 
			move forward. Freedom of religion and expression lead to a strong 
			and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is 
			why steps like reopening Halki Seminary will send such an important 
			signal inside Turkey and beyond. An enduring commitment to the rule 
			of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from 
			justice for all people. Robust minority rights let societies benefit 
			from the full measure of contributions from all citizens.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I say this as the 
			President of a country that not very long ago made it hard for 
			somebody who looks like me to vote, much less be President of the 
			United States. But it is precisely that capacity to change that 
			enriches our countries. Every challenge that we face is more easily 
			met if we tend to our own democratic foundation. This work is never 
			over. That's why, in the United States, we recently ordered the 
			prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. That's why we prohibited -- without 
			exception or equivocation -- the use of torture. All of us have to 
			change. And sometimes change is hard.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another issue that 
			confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal 
			with the past. The United States is still working through some of 
			our own darker periods in our history. Facing the Washington 
			Monument that I spoke of is a memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the man 
			who freed those who were enslaved even after Washington led our 
			Revolution. Our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery 
			and segregation, the past treatment of Native Americans.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Human endeavor is by its 
			nature imperfect. History is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be 
			a heavy weight. Each country must work through its past. And 
			reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future. I know 
			there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 
			1915. And while there's been a good deal of commentary about my 
			views, it's really about how the Turkish and Armenian people deal 
			with the past. And the best way forward for the Turkish and Armenian 
			people is a process that works through the past in a way that is 
			honest, open and constructive.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've already seen 
			historic and courageous steps taken by Turkish and Armenian leaders. 
			These contacts hold out the promise of a new day. An open border 
			would return the Turkish and Armenian people to a peaceful and 
			prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations. So I 
			want you to know that the United States strongly supports the full 
			normalization of relations between Turkey and Armenia. It is a cause 
			worth working towards.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It speaks to Turkey's 
			leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region 
			to have normal and peaceful relations with all the South Caucasus 
			nations. And to advance that peace, you can play a constructive role 
			in helping to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has 
			continued for far too long.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Advancing peace also 
			includes the disputes that persist in the Eastern Mediterranean. And 
			here there's a cause for hope. The two Cypriot leaders have an 
			opportunity through their commitment to negotiations under the 
			United Nations Good Offices Mission. The United States is willing to 
			offer all the help sought by the parties as they work towards a just 
			and lasting settlement that reunifies Cyprus into a bizonal and 
			bicommunal federation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These efforts speak to 
			one part of the critical region that surrounds Turkey. And when we 
			consider the challenges before us, on issue after issue, we share 
			common goals.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the Middle East, we 
			share the goal of a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. 
			Let me be clear: The United States strongly supports the goal of two 
			states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and 
			security. That is a goal shared by Palestinians, Israelis, and 
			people of goodwill around the world. That is a goal that the parties 
			agreed to in the road map and at Annapolis. That is a goal that I 
			will actively pursue as President of the United States.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know the road ahead 
			will be difficult. Both Israelis and Palestinians must take steps 
			that are necessary to build confidence and trust. Both Israelis and 
			Palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made. 
			Both must overcome longstanding passions and the politics of the 
			moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States and 
			Turkey can help the Palestinians and Israelis make this journey. 
			Like the United States, Turkey has been a friend and partner in 
			Israel's quest for security. And like the United States, you seek a 
			future of opportunity and statehood for the Palestinians. So now, 
			working together, we must not give into pessimism and mistrust. We 
			must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by 
			supporting negotiations between Syria and Israel. We must extend a 
			hand to those Palestinians who are in need, while helping them 
			strengthen their own institutions. We must reject the use of terror, 
			and recognize that Israel's security concerns are legitimate.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The peace of the region 
			will also be advanced if Iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions. 
			Now, as I made clear in Prague yesterday, no one is served by the 
			spread of nuclear weapons, least of all Turkey. You live in a 
			difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security 
			of this nation well. This part of the world has known enough 
			violence. It has known enough hatred. It does not need a race for an 
			ever-more powerful tool of destruction.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I have made it 
			clear to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran that 
			the United States seeks engagement based on mutual interest and 
			mutual respect. We want Iran to play its rightful role in the 
			community of nations. Iran is a great civilization. We want them to 
			engage in the economic and political integration that brings 
			prosperity and security. But Iran's leaders must choose whether they 
			will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their 
			people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So both Turkey and the 
			United States support a secure and united Iraq that does not serve 
			as a safe haven for terrorists. I know there were differences about 
			whether to go to war. There were differences within my own country, 
			as well. But now we must come together as we end this war 
			responsibly, because the future of Iraq is inseparable from the 
			future of the broader region. As I've already announced, and many of 
			you are aware, the United States will remove our combat brigades by 
			the end of next August, while working with the Iraqi government as 
			they take responsibility for security. And we will work with Iraq, 
			Turkey, and all Iraq's neighbors, to forge a new dialogue that 
			reconciles differences and advances our common security.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Make no mistake, though: 
			Iraq, Turkey, and the United States face a common threat from 
			terrorism. That includes the al Qaeda terrorists who have sought to 
			drive Iraqis apart and destroy their country. That includes the PKK. 
			There is no excuse for terror against any nation. As 
			President, and as a NATO ally, I pledge that you will have our 
			support against the terrorist activities of the PKK or anyone else. 
			These efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build 
			ties of cooperation between Turkey, the Iraqi government, and Iraq's 
			Kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education 
			and opportunity and democracy for the Kurdish population here inside 
			Turkey.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we share the 
			common goal of denying al Qaeda a safe haven in Pakistan or 
			Afghanistan. The world has come too far to let this region 
			backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists plot further attacks. 
			That's why we are committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, 
			dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda. That is why we are increasing our 
			efforts to train Afghans to sustain their own security, and to 
			reconcile former adversaries. That's why we are increasing our 
			support for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, so that we stand 
			on the side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the 
			promise of a better life.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey has been a true 
			partner. Your troops were among the first in the International 
			Security Assistance Force. You have sacrificed much in this 
			endeavor. Now we must achieve our goals together. I appreciate that 
			you've offered to help us train and support Afghan security forces, 
			and expand opportunity across the region. Together, we can rise to 
			meet this challenge like we have so many before.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there have been 
			difficulties these last few years. I know that the trust that binds 
			the United States and Turkey has been strained, and I know that 
			strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith is practiced. 
			So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not, 
			and will never be, at war with Islam. In fact, our 
			partnership with the Muslim world is critical not just in rolling 
			back the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject, but

			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to be clear 
			that America's relationship with the Muslim community, the Muslim 
			world, cannot, and will not, just be based upon opposition to 
			terrorism. We seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and 
			mutual respect. We will listen carefully, we will bridge 
			misunderstandings, and we will seek common ground. We will be 
			respectful, even when we do not agree. We will convey our deep 
			appreciation for the Islamic faith, which has done so much over the 
			centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country. The 
			United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other 
			Americans have Muslims in their families or have lived in a 
			Muslim-majority country. I know, because I am one of them.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Above all, above all we 
			will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future. 
			I want to help more children get the education that they need to 
			succeed. We want to promote health care in places where people are 
			vulnerable. We want to expand the trade and investment that can 
			bring prosperity for all people. In the months ahead, I will present 
			specific programs to advance these goals. Our focus will be on what 
			we can do, in partnership with people across the Muslim world, to 
			advance our common hopes and our common dreams. And when people look 
			back on this time, let it be said of America that we extended the 
			hand of friendship to all people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There's an old Turkish 
			proverb: &quot;You cannot put out fire with flames.&quot; America knows this. 
			Turkey knows this. There's some who must be met by force, they will 
			not compromise. But force alone cannot solve our problems, and it is 
			no alternative to extremism. The future must belong to those who 
			create, not those who destroy. That is the future we must work for, 
			and we must work for it together.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are those 
			who like to debate Turkey's future. They see your country at the 
			crossroads of continents, and touched by the currents of history. 
			They know that this has been a place where civilizations meet, and 
			different peoples come together. They wonder whether you will be 
			pulled in one direction or another.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I believe here is 
			what they don't understand: Turkey's greatness lies in your ability 
			to be at the center of things. This is not where East and West 
			divide -- this is where they come together. In the 
			beauty of your culture. In the richness of your history. In the 
			strength of your democracy. In your hopes for tomorrow.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am honored to stand 
			here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach 
			for together -- and to reaffirm America's commitment to our strong 
			and enduring friendship.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much. Thank you. 
			Thank you.</font></p></div>
