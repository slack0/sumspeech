transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much, Strobe, 
		for your extraordinary leadership here at Brookings, and thanks to all 
		of you in attendance.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Almost exactly one year ago, 
		on a frigid winter's day, I met with my new economic team at the 
		headquarters of my presidential transition offices in Chicago.&nbsp; And over 
		the course of four hours, my advisors presented an analysis of where the 
		economy at that time stood, accompanied by a chilling set of charts and 
		graphs, predicting where we might end up.&nbsp; It was an unforgettable 
		series of presentations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christy Romer -- who's here 
		today -- tapped to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as 
		Larry Summers, who I'd chosen to head the National Economic Council, 
		described an imminent downturn comparable in its severity to almost 
		nothing since the 1930s.&nbsp; Tim Geithner, my incoming Treasury Secretary, 
		reported that the financial system, shaken by the subprime crisis, had 
		halted almost all lending, which in turn threatened to pull the broader 
		economy in a downward spiral.&nbsp; Peter Orszag, my incoming Budget 
		Director, closed out the proceedings with an entirely dismal report on 
		the fiscal health of the country, with growing deficits and debt 
		stretching to the horizon.&nbsp; Having concluded that it was too late for me 
		to request a recount -- I tasked my team with mapping out 
		a plan to tackle the crisis on all fronts.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It wasn't long after that 
		meeting, as we shaped this economic plan, that we began to see some of 
		these forecasts materialize.&nbsp; Over the previous year, it was obvious 
		that folks were facing hard times.&nbsp; As I traveled across the country 
		during the long campaign, I would meet men and women bearing the brunt 
		of not only a deepening recession, but also years -- even decades -- of 
		growing strains on middle class families.&nbsp; But now the country was 
		experiencing something far worse.&nbsp; Our gross domestic product -- the sum 
		total of all that our economy produces&nbsp; -- fell at the fastest rate in a 
		quarter century.&nbsp; Five trillion dollars of Americans' household wealth 
		evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, pensions, and home values 
		plummeted.&nbsp; We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month, 
		equivalent to the population of the state of Vermont.&nbsp; That was true in 
		December, January, February, March.&nbsp; The fear among economists across 
		the political spectrum that was -- was that we were rapidly plummeting 
		towards a second Great Depression.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, in the weeks and months 
		that followed, we undertook a series of difficult steps to prevent that 
		outcome.&nbsp; And we were forced to take those steps largely without the 
		help of an opposition party, which, unfortunately, after having presided 
		over the decision-making that had led to the crisis, decided to hand it 
		over to others to solve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We acted to get lending 
		flowing again so businesses could get loans to buy equipment, and 
		ordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes and cars, to go to 
		college, and to start or run businesses.&nbsp; We enacted measures to stem 
		the tide of foreclosures in our housing market, helping responsible 
		homeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broader decline 
		in home values which was eating away at what tends to be a family's 
		largest asset.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To achieve this, and to 
		prevent economic collapse, we were forced to extend assistance to some 
		of the very banks and financial institutions whose actions had helped 
		precipitate the turmoil.&nbsp; We also took steps to prevent the rapid 
		dissolution of the American auto industry -- which faced a crisis partly 
		of its own making -- to prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of 
		jobs during an already fragile, shaky time.&nbsp; These were not decisions 
		that were popular or satisfying; these were decisions that were 
		necessary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even as we worked to 
		address the crises in our banking sector, in our housing market, and in 
		our auto industry, we also began attacking our economic crisis on a 
		broader front.&nbsp; Less than one month after taking office we enacted the 
		most sweeping economic recovery package in history:&nbsp; the American 
		Recovery and Reinvestment Act.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Recovery Act was divided 
		into three parts.&nbsp; One-third went for tax relief for small businesses 
		and 95 percent of working families.&nbsp; Another third was for emergency 
		relief to help folks who've borne the brunt of this recession.&nbsp; We 
		extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 17 million 
		Americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families relying 
		on COBRA. And for state and local governments facing historic budget 
		shortfalls as demand for services went up and revenues went down, we 
		provided assistance that has saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of 
		teachers and public school workers, firefighters and police officers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The last third of the 
		Recovery Act is for investments to put Americans to work doing the work 
		that America needs done:&nbsp; doubling our capacity in renewable energy like 
		wind and solar; computerizing medical records to save money and lives; 
		providing the largest boost to medical research in history; renovating 
		classrooms and school laboratories; and upgrading roads and railways as 
		part of the largest investment in infrastructure since the creation of 
		the Interstate Highway System half a century ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And even as the Recovery Act 
		has created jobs and spurred growth, we have not let up in our efforts 
		to take every responsible action to get the economy growing and America 
		working.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This fall, I signed into law 
		more than $30 billion in tax cuts for struggling businesses, extended an 
		effective tax credit for homebuyers, and provided additional 
		unemployment insurance for one million Americans.&nbsp; And the Treasury is 
		continuing to adapt our financial stability plan, helping to facilitate 
		the flow of small credit to small businesses and families.&nbsp; In addition, 
		we're working to break down barriers and open overseas markets so our 
		companies can better compete globally, creating jobs in America by 
		exporting our products around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, partly as a result of 
		these and other steps, we are in a very different place today than we 
		were one year ago.&nbsp; We may forget, but we're in a very different place.&nbsp; 
		We can safely say that we are no longer facing the potential collapse of 
		our financial system and we've avoided the depression many feared.&nbsp; Our 
		economy is growing for the first time in a year, and the swing from 
		contraction to expansion since the beginning of the year is the largest 
		in nearly three decades.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we're no longer 
		seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were.&nbsp; In 
		fact we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last 
		month.&nbsp; This is welcome news, and news made possible in part by the up 
		to 1.6 million jobs that the Recovery Act has already created and saved 
		according to the Congressional Budget Office.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I'm here today because 
		our work is far from done.&nbsp; For even though we've reduced the deluge of 
		job losses to a relative trickle, we are not yet creating jobs at a pace 
		to help all those families who've been swept up in the flood.&nbsp; There are 
		more than 7 million fewer Americans with jobs today than when this 
		recession began.&nbsp; That's a staggering figure, and one that reflects not 
		only the depths of the hole from which we must ascend, but also a 
		continuing human tragedy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was mentioned that I was 
		in Allentown, Pennsylvania, this past weekend, and went to a job center 
		where people were engaged in job search.&nbsp; And it ran the spectrum -- 
		blacks, whites, Hispanics, young people who were just starting their 
		careers, individuals 50, 60 years old, looking for a job.&nbsp; And they were 
		putting a brave face on it, confident that eventually things would work 
		out, but you could also see the sense of anxiety, the fear that perhaps 
		this time it was different.&nbsp; Sometimes it's hard to break out of the 
		bubble here in Washington and remind ourselves that behind these 
		statistics are people's lives, their capacity to do right by their 
		families.&nbsp; It speaks to an urgent need to accelerate job growth in the 
		short term while laying a new foundation for lasting economic growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My economic team has been 
		considering a full range of additional ideas to help accelerate the pace 
		of private sector hiring.&nbsp; We held a jobs forum at the White House that 
		brought together small business owners, CEOs, union members, economists, 
		folks from non-profits, and state and local officials to talk about job 
		creation.&nbsp; And I've asked people to lead forums in their own communities 
		-- sending the results to me -- so we are hearing as many voices as 
		possible as we refine our proposals.&nbsp; We've already heard a number of 
		good ideas, and I know we'll learn of many more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I want to outline 
		some of the broader steps that I believe should be at the heart of our 
		effort to accelerate job growth -- those areas that will generate the 
		greatest number of jobs while generating the greatest value for our 
		economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, we're proposing a 
		series of steps to help small businesses grow and hire new staff.&nbsp; Over 
		the past 15 years, small businesses have created roughly 65 percent of 
		all new jobs in America.&nbsp; These are companies formed around kitchen 
		tables in family meetings, formed when an entrepreneur takes a chance on 
		a dream, formed when a worker decides it's time she became her own 
		boss.&nbsp; These are also companies that drive innovation, producing 13 
		times more patents per employee than large companies.&nbsp; And it's worth 
		remembering, every once in a while a small business becomes a big 
		business -- and changes the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why it's so important 
		that we help small business struggling to stay open, or struggling to 
		open in the first place, during these difficult times.&nbsp; Building on the 
		tax cuts in the Recovery Act, we're proposing a complete elimination of 
		capital gains taxes on small business investment along with an extension 
		of write-offs to encourage small businesses to expand in the coming 
		year.&nbsp; And I believe it's worthwhile to create a tax incentive to 
		encourage small businesses to add and keep employees, and I'm going to 
		work with Congress to pass one.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, these steps will help, 
		but we also have to address the continuing struggle of small businesses 
		to get loans that they need to start up and grow.&nbsp; To that end, we're 
		proposing to waive fees and increase the guarantees for SBA-backed 
		loans.&nbsp; And I'm asking my Treasury Secretary to continue mobilizing the 
		remaining TARP funds to facilitate lending to small businesses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, we're proposing a 
		boost in investment in the nation's infrastructure beyond what was 
		included in the Recovery Act, to continue modernizing our transportation 
		and communications networks.&nbsp; These are needed public works that engage 
		private sector companies, spurring hiring all across the country.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Already, more than 10,000 of 
		these projects have been funded through the Recovery Act.&nbsp; And by 
		design, Recovery Act work on roads, bridges, water systems, Superfund 
		sites, broadband networks, and clean energy projects will all be ramping 
		up in the months ahead.&nbsp; It was planned this way for two reasons:&nbsp; so 
		the impact would be felt over a two-year period; and, more importantly, 
		because we wanted to do this right.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The potential for abuse in a 
		program of this magnitude, while operating at such a fast pace, was 
		enormous.&nbsp; So I asked Vice President Biden and others to make sure to 
		the extent humanly possible that the investments were sound, the 
		projects worthy, and the execution efficient.&nbsp; What this means is that 
		we're going to see even more work -- and workers -- on recovery projects 
		in the next six months than we saw in the last six months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even so, there are many more 
		worthy projects than there were dollars to fund them.&nbsp; I recognize that 
		by their nature these projects often take time, and will therefore 
		create jobs over time.&nbsp; But the need for jobs will also last beyond next 
		year and the benefits of these investments will last years beyond that.&nbsp; 
		So adding to this initiative to rebuild America's infrastructure is the 
		right thing to do.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, I'm calling on 
		Congress to consider a new program to provide incentives for consumers 
		who retrofit their homes to become more energy-efficient, which we know 
		creates jobs, saves money for families, and reduces the pollution that 
		threatens our environment.&nbsp; And I'm proposing that we expand select 
		Recovery Act initiatives to promote energy efficiency and clean energy 
		jobs which have been proven to be particularly popular and effective.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a positive sign that 
		many of these programs drew so many applicants for funding that a lot of 
		strong proposals -- proposals that will leverage private capital and 
		create jobs quickly -- did not make the cut.&nbsp; With additional resources, 
		in areas like advanced manufacturing of wind turbines and solar panels, 
		for instance, we can help turn good ideas into good private sector jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, as we are moving 
		forward in these areas, we should also extend the relief in the Recovery 
		Act, including emergency assistance to seniors, unemployment insurance 
		benefits, COBRA, and relief to states and localities to prevent 
		layoffs.&nbsp; This will help folks weathering these storms, while boosting 
		consumer spending and promoting job growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there's only so 
		much government can do. Job creation will ultimately depend on the real 
		job creators:&nbsp; businesses across America.&nbsp; We were encouraged today to 
		hear from the Business Roundtable that their survey showed greater 
		confidence and greater potential investment coming out of the business 
		community.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Government can help lay the 
		groundwork on which the private sector can better generate jobs, growth, 
		and innovation.&nbsp; After all, small business tax relief is not a 
		substitute for ingenuity and industriousness by our entrepreneurs -- but 
		it can help those with good ideas to grow and expand.&nbsp; Incentives to 
		promote energy efficiency and clean energy manufacturing don't 
		automatically create jobs or lower carbon emissions -- but these steps 
		provide a framework in which companies can compete and innovate to 
		create those jobs and reduce energy consumption.&nbsp; And while modernizing 
		the physical and virtual networks that connect us will create 
		private-sector jobs, they'll do so while making it possible for 
		companies to more easily and effectively move their products across this 
		country and around the world, and that will create more jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And given the challenges of 
		accelerating the pace of hiring in the private sector, these targeted 
		initiatives are right and they are needed.&nbsp; But with a fiscal crisis to 
		match our economic crisis, we also must be prudent about how we fund 
		it.&nbsp; So to help support these efforts, we are going to wind down the 
		Troubled Asset Relief Program -- or TARP -- the fund created to 
		stabilize the financial system so banks would lend again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't think I have to tell 
		you there has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency 
		program than TARP, which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may 
		have been -- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire 
		financial system.&nbsp; Launched hastily -- understandably, but hastily -- 
		under the last administration, the TARP program was flawed, and we have 
		worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly.&nbsp; And today, 
		TARP has served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we 
		expected.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, because of our 
		stewardship of this program, and the transparency and accountability we 
		put in place, TARP is expected to cost the taxpayers at least $200 
		billion less than what was anticipated just this past summer.&nbsp; And the 
		assistance to banks, once thought to cost taxpayers untold billions, is 
		on track to actually reap billions in profits for the taxpaying public.&nbsp; 
		So this gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought 
		possible and to shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on 
		Wall Street to help create jobs on Main Street.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Small business, 
		infrastructure, clean energy -- these are areas in which we can put 
		Americans to work while putting our nation on a sturdier economic 
		footing.&nbsp; That foundation for sustained economic growth -- that must be 
		our continuing focus and our ultimate goal.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've said this before.&nbsp; Even 
		before this particular crisis, much of our growth for a decade or more 
		had been fueled by unsustainable consumer debt and reckless financial 
		speculation, while we ignored the fundamental challenges that hold the 
		key to our economic prosperity.&nbsp; We cannot simply go back to the way 
		things used to be.&nbsp; We can't go back to an economy that yielded cycle 
		after cycle of speculative booms and painful busts.&nbsp; We can't continue 
		to accept an education system in which our students trail their peers in 
		other countries, and a health care system in which exploding costs put 
		our businesses at a competitive disadvantage.&nbsp; And we cannot continue to 
		ignore the clean energy challenge or cede global leadership in the 
		emerging industries of the 21st century.&nbsp; And that's why, even as we 
		strive to meet the crisis of the moment, we have insisted on laying a 
		new foundation for the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because an educated 
		workforce is essential to a 21st century global economy, we've launched 
		a competitive Race to the Top fund through the Recovery Act to reform 
		our schools and raise achievement, especially in math and science.&nbsp; And 
		we've made college more affordable, proposed a historic set of reforms 
		and investments in community college, and set a goal of once again 
		leading the world in producing college graduates by the year 2020.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because even the 
		best-trained worker in the world can't compete if our businesses are 
		saddled with rapidly increasing health care costs, we are fighting to do 
		what we have discussed in this country for generations -- finally 
		reforming our nation's broken health insurance system and relieving this 
		unsustainable burden.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because our economic future 
		depends on a financial system that encourages sound investments, honest 
		dealings, and long-term growth, we've proposed the most ambitious 
		financial reforms since the Great Depression.&nbsp; We'll set and enforce 
		clear rules of the road, close loopholes in oversight, charge a new 
		agency with protecting consumers and address the dangerous, systemic 
		risks that brought us to the brink of disaster.&nbsp; These reforms are 
		moving through Congress, we're working to keep those reforms strong, and 
		I'm looking forward to signing them into law.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And because our economic 
		future depends on our leadership in the industries of the future, we are 
		investing in basic applied research, and working to create the 
		incentives to build a new clean energy economy.&nbsp; For we know the nation 
		that leads in clean energy will be the nation that leads the world.&nbsp; I 
		want America to be that nation.&nbsp; I want America's prosperity to be 
		powered by what we invent and pioneer -- not just what we borrow and 
		what we consume.&nbsp; And I know that we can and will be that nation if we 
		are willing to do what it takes to get there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there are those who 
		claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on the one 
		hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other.&nbsp; 
		This is a false choice.&nbsp; Ensuring that economic growth and job creation 
		are strong and sustained is critical to ensuring that we are increasing 
		revenues and decreasing spending on things like unemployment insurance 
		so that our deficits will start coming down.&nbsp; At the same time, 
		instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives 
		the private sector the confidence to make long-term investments in our 
		people and in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So one of the central goals 
		of this administration is restoring fiscal responsibility.&nbsp; Even as we 
		have had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term, we've 
		begun to make the hard choices necessary to get our country on a more 
		stable fiscal footing in the long run.&nbsp; So let me just be clear here.&nbsp; 
		Despite what some have claimed, the cost of the Recovery Act is only a 
		very small part of our current budget imbalance.&nbsp; In reality, the 
		deficit had been building dramatically over the previous eight years.&nbsp; 
		We have a structural gap between the money going out and the money 
		coming in.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Folks passed tax cuts and 
		expansive entitlement programs without paying for any of it -- even as 
		health care costs kept rising, year after year.&nbsp; As a result, the 
		deficit had reached $1.3 trillion when we walked into the White House.&nbsp; 
		And I'd note:&nbsp; These budget-busting tax cuts and spending programs were 
		approved by many of the same people who are now waxing political about 
		fiscal responsibility, while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by 
		getting health care costs under control.&nbsp; It's a sight to see.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact is we have refused 
		to go along with business as usual; we are taking responsibility for 
		every dollar we spend.&nbsp; We've done what some said was impossible:&nbsp; 
		preventing wasteful spending on outdated weapons systems that even the 
		Pentagon said it didn't want.&nbsp; We've combed the budget, cutting waste 
		and excess wherever we could.&nbsp; I'm still committed to halving the 
		deficit we inherited by the end of my first term -- cutting it in half.&nbsp; 
		And I made clear from day one that I would not sign a health insurance 
		reform bill if it raised the deficit by one dime -- and neither the 
		House, nor the Senate bill does.&nbsp; We've begun not only changing policies 
		in Washington, we've also begun to change the culture in Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, the economic 
		crisis of the past year was not just the result of weaknesses in our 
		economy.&nbsp; It was also the result of weaknesses in our political system, 
		because for decades, too many in Washington put off the hard decisions.&nbsp; 
		For decades, we've watched as efforts to solve tough problems have 
		fallen prey to the bitterness of partisanship, to prosaic concerns of 
		politics, to ever-quickening news cycles, to endless campaigns focused 
		on scoring points instead of meeting our common challenges.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've seen the consequences 
		of this failure of responsibility.&nbsp; The American people have paid a 
		heavy price.&nbsp; And the question we'll have to answer now is if we're 
		going to learn from our past, or if -- even in the aftermath of disaster 
		-- we're going to repeat those same mistakes.&nbsp; As the alarm bells fade, 
		the din of Washington rises, as the forces of the status quo marshal 
		their resources, we can be sure that answering this question will be a 
		fight to the finish.&nbsp; But I have every hope and expectation that we can 
		rise to this moment, that we can transcend the failures of the past, 
		that we can once again take responsibility for our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every night I read letters 
		and e-mails sent to me from people across America -- ordinary folks, 
		people who share their hopes and their hardships, their faith in this 
		country, their frustration with what's happened in this economy.&nbsp; I hear 
		from small business owners worried about making payroll, keeping their 
		doors open.&nbsp; I hear from mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, who've 
		seen one or two or more family members out of work.&nbsp; The toughest 
		letters are in children's handwriting -- kids write to me, my dad just 
		lost a job; my grandma is sick, she can't afford health insurance -- 
		kids who can't just be kids because they're worried about mom having her 
		hours cut or dad losing a job, or a family without health insurance.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These folks aren't looking 
		for a handout, they're not looking for a bailout -- just like those 
		people I visited in Allentown -- all they're looking for is a chance to 
		make their own way, to work, to succeed using their talents and skills.&nbsp; 
		And they're looking for folks in Washington to have a seriousness of 
		purpose that matches the reality of their struggle.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everywhere I've gone, every 
		stop I've made, there are people like this, men and women who have faced 
		misfortune, but who stand ready to build a better future:&nbsp; students 
		ready to learn, workers eager to work, scientists on the brink of 
		discovery, entrepreneurs seeking the chance to open a small business.&nbsp; 
		Everywhere I go, there are once-shuttered factories just waiting to whir 
		back to life in burgeoning industries.&nbsp; There is a nation ready to meet 
		the challenges of this new age and to lead the world in this new 
		century.&nbsp; And as we look back on the progress of the past year, and look 
		forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that we will do 
		exactly that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These have been a tough two 
		years.&nbsp; And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead.&nbsp; But the 
		storms of the past are receding.&nbsp; The skies are brightening.&nbsp; And the 
		horizon is beckoning once more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
