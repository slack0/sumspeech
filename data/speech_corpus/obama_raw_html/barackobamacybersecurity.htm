		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We meet today at a transformational moment -- a moment in 
			history when our interconnected world presents us, at once, with 
			great promise but also great peril.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, over the past 
			four months my Administration has taken decisive steps to seize the 
			promise and confront these perils. We're working to recover from a 
			global recession while laying a new foundation for lasting 
			prosperity.&nbsp;We're strengthening our armed forces as they fight two 
			wars, at the same time we're renewing American leadership to 
			confront unconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to 
			terrorism, from climate change to pandemic disease.&nbsp;And we're 
			bringing to government -- and to this White House -- unprecedented 
			transparency and accountability and new ways for Americans to 
			participate in their democracy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But none of this 
			progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century 
			challenges can be fully met, without America's digital 
			infrastructure -- the backbone that underpins a prosperous economy 
			and a strong military and an open and efficient government.&nbsp;Without 
			that foundation we can't get the job done.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's long been said 
			that the revolutions in communications and information technology 
			have given birth to a virtual world.&nbsp;But make no mistake:&nbsp;This world 
			-- cyberspace -- is a world that we depend on every single day.&nbsp;It's 
			our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptops and cell 
			phones and Blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of 
			our lives.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's the broadband 
			networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local 
			networks in our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the 
			massive grids that power our nation.&nbsp;It's the classified military 
			and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the World Wide Web 
			that has made us more interconnected than at any time in human 
			history.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So cyberspace is 
			real.&nbsp;And so are the risks that come with it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's the great irony 
			of our <i>Information Age</i> -- the very technologies that empower us to 
			create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and 
			destroy.&nbsp;And this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we 
			experience every day.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's about the privacy 
			and the economic security of American families.&nbsp;We rely on the 
			Internet to pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes.&nbsp;But 
			we've had to learn a whole new vocabulary just to stay ahead of the 
			cyber criminals who would do us harm: 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">
			<font color="#0000FF">spyware</font></a> and 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">
			<font color="#0000FF">malware</font></a> and 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">
			<font color="#0000FF">spoofing</font></a> and
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">
			<font color="#0000FF">phishing</font></a> and
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnets">
			<font color="#0000FF">botnets</font></a>.&nbsp;Millions of Americans have been 
			victimized, their privacy violated, their 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft">
			<font color="#0000FF">identities stolen</font></a>, their 
			lives upended, and their wallets emptied.&nbsp;According to one survey, 
			in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost Americans more than 
			8 billion dollars.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know how it feels to 
			have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the people 
			around me.&nbsp;It's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed 
			the Internet and technology to transform our politics.&nbsp;What isn't 
			widely known is that during the general election hackers managed to 
			penetrate our computer systems.&nbsp;To all of you who donated to our 
			campaign, I want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website 
			was untouched.&nbsp;So your confidential personal and financial 
			information was protected.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But between August and 
			October, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaign 
			files, from policy position papers to travel plans.&nbsp;And we worked 
			closely with the CIA, with the FBI and the Secret Service, and 
			hired security consultants to restore the security of our systems. 
			It was a powerful reminder: In this <i>Information Age</i>, one of your 
			greatest strengths -- in our case, our ability to communicate to a 
			wide range of supporters through the Internet -- could also be one 
			of your greatest vulnerabilities.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a matter, as 
			well, of America's economic competitiveness.&nbsp;The small businesswoman 
			in St. Louis, the bond trader in the New York Stock Exchange, the 
			workers at a global shipping company in Memphis, the young 
			entrepreneur in Silicon Valley -- they all need the networks to make 
			the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery, the next great 
			breakthrough. E-commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 
			billion dollars in retail sales.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But every day we see 
			waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information -- the 
			disgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles 
			away, organized crime, the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign 
			intelligence services. In 
			<a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/02/data_breach_led_to_multi-milli.html">
			<font color="#0000FF">one brazen act last year</font></a>, thieves used 
			stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 
			ATM machines in 49 cities around the world -- and they did it in 
			just 30 minutes.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">A single employee of an American company was 
			convicted of 
			<a href="https://www.scmagazineus.com/400-million-corporate-espionage-incident-at-dupont/article/34633/">
			<font color="#0000FF">stealing intellectual property reportedly worth 400 
			million dollars</font></a>.&nbsp;It's been estimated that last year alone cyber 
			criminals stole intellectual property from businesses worldwide 
			worth up to 1 trillion dollars.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In short, America's 
			economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on 
			cybersecurity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is also a 
			matter of public safety and national security.&nbsp;We count on computer 
			networks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water.&nbsp;We 
			rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control.&nbsp;Yet 
			we know that cyber intruders have probed our electrical grid and 
			that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities 
			into darkness.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our technological 
			advantage is a key to America's military dominance. But our defense 
			and military networks are under constant attack.&nbsp;Al Qaeda and other 
			terrorist groups have spoken of their desire to unleash a cyber 
			attack on our country -- attacks that are harder to detect and 
			harder to defend against. Indeed, in today's world, acts of terror 
			could come not only from a few extremists in suicide vests but from 
			a few key strokes on the computer -- a weapon of mass disruption.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In one of the most 
			serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, 
			<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66552/william-j-lynn-iii/defending-a-new-domain">
			<font color="#0000FF">several thousand computers were infected last year</font></a>
			<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/11/army-bans-usb-d/">
			<font color="#0000FF">by malicious 
			software -- malware</font></a>.&nbsp;And while no sensitive information was 
			compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give up those 
			external memory devices -- thumb drives -- changing the way they 
			used their computers every day.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And last year we had a 
			glimpse of the future face of war.&nbsp;As Russian tanks rolled into 
			Georgia, cyber attacks crippled Georgian government websites. The 
			terrorists that sowed so much death and destruction in Mumbai relied 
			not only on guns and grenades but also on GPS and phones using 
			voice-over-the-Internet.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For all these reasons, 
			it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic 
			and national security challenges we face as a nation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's also clear that 
			we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a 
			country.&nbsp; In recent years, some progress has been made at the 
			federal level.&nbsp;But just as we failed in the past to invest in our 
			physical infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges and rails -- we've 
			failed to invest in the security of our digital infrastructure.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No single official 
			oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no 
			single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope 
			and scale of the challenge.&nbsp;Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, 
			federal agencies have overlapping missions and don't coordinate and 
			communicate nearly as well as they should -- with each other or with 
			the private sector.&nbsp;We saw this in the disorganized response to 
			<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">
			<font color="#0000FF">Conficker</font></a></i>, the 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_worm">
			<font color="#0000FF">Internet worm</font></a> that in recent months has infected 
			millions of computers around the world.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This status quo is no 
			longer acceptable -- not when there's so much at stake. We can and 
			we must do better.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why shortly 
			after taking office I directed my National Security Council and 
			Homeland Security Council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the 
			federal government's efforts to defend our information and 
			communications infrastructure and to recommend the best way to 
			ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well 
			as our prosperity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our review was open 
			and transparent.&nbsp;I want to acknowledge, 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Hathaway">
			<font color="#0000FF">Melissa Hathaway</font></a> -- who is 
			here -- who is the Acting Senior Director for Cyberspace on our 
			National Security Council, who led the review team, as well as the 
			<a href="https://csis.org/"><font color="#0000FF">Center for Strategic and International Studies</font></a> bipartisan
			<a href="https://csis.org/program/commission-cybersecurity-44th-presidency">
			<font color="#0000FF">Commission 
			on Cybersecurity</font></a>, and all who were part of our 60-day review 
			team.&nbsp;They listened to a wide variety of groups, many of which are 
			represented here today and I want to thank for their input:&nbsp;industry 
			and academia, civil liberties and private -- privacy advocates.&nbsp;We 
			listened to every level and branch of government -- from local to 
			state to federal, civilian, military, homeland as well as 
			intelligence, Congress and international partners, as well.&nbsp;I 
			consulted with my national security teams, my homeland security 
			teams, and my economic advisors.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today I'm releasing 
			<a href="../PDFFiles/cyberspacepolicyreview2009final.pdf">
			<font color="#0000FF">a 
			report on our review</font></a>, and can announce that my Administration will 
			pursue a new comprehensive approach to securing America's digital 
			infrastructure.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This new approach 
			starts at the top, with this commitment from me:&nbsp;From now on, our 
			digital infrastructure -- the networks and computers we depend on 
			every day -- will be treated as they should be:&nbsp;as a strategic 
			national asset.&nbsp;Protecting this infrastructure will be a national 
			security priority. We will ensure that these networks are secure, 
			trustworthy and resilient.&nbsp;We will deter, prevent, detect, and 
			defend against attacks and recover quickly from any disruptions or 
			damage.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To give these efforts 
			the high-level focus and attention they deserve -- and as part of 
			the new, single National Security Staff announced this week -- I'm 
			creating a new office here at the White House that will be led by 
			the Cybersecurity Coordinator.&nbsp; Because of the critical importance 
			of this work, 
			<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/12/22/introducing-new-cybersecurity-coordinator">
			<font color="#0000FF">I will personally select this official</font></a>.&nbsp;I'll depend on 
			this official in all matters relating to cybersecurity, and this 
			official will have my full support and regular access to me as we 
			confront these challenges.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, I want to focus 
			on the important responsibilities this office will 
			fulfill:&nbsp;orchestrating and integrating all cybersecurity policies 
			for the government; working closely with the Office of Management 
			and Budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities; and, 
			in the event of major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our 
			response.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To ensure that federal 
			cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, my 
			Cybersecurity Coordinator will be a member of the National Security 
			Staff as well as the staff of my National Economic Council.&nbsp;To 
			ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this 
			office will also include an official with a portfolio specifically 
			dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of the 
			American people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There's much work to 
			be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range of 
			actions that we will pursue in five key areas.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, working in 
			partnership with the communities represented here today, we will 
			develop a new comprehensive strategy to secure America's information 
			and communications networks. To ensure a coordinated approach across 
			government, my Cybersecurity Coordinator will work closely with my 
			Chief Technology Officer, 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneesh_Chopra">
			<font color="#0000FF">Aneesh Chopra</font></a>, and my Chief Information 
			Officer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra">
			<font color="#0000FF">Vivek Kundra</font></a>. To ensure accountability in federal agencies, 
			cybersecurity will be designated as one of my key management 
			priorities.&nbsp;Clear milestones and performances metrics will measure 
			progress.&nbsp;And as we develop our strategy, we will be open and 
			transparent, which is why you'll find today's report and a wealth of 
			related information on our Web site,<font color="#0000FF"> 
			<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/search/site/Cybersecurity">
			<font color="#0000FF">www.whitehouse.gov</font></a>.</font></font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, we will work 
			with all the key players -- including state and local governments 
			and the private sector -- to ensure an organized and unified 
			response to future cyber incidents.&nbsp;Given the enormous damage that 
			can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses will 
			not do.&nbsp;Nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after 
			incidents or attacks occur.&nbsp;Just as we do for natural disasters, we 
			have to have plans and resources in place beforehand -- sharing 
			information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, we will 
			strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this 
			endeavor.&nbsp;The vast majority of our critical information 
			infrastructure in the United States is owned and operated by the 
			private sector.&nbsp;So let me be very clear:&nbsp;My Administration will not 
			dictate security standards for private companies. On the contrary, 
			we will collaborate with industry to find technology solutions that 
			ensure our security and promote prosperity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fourth, we will 
			continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development 
			necessary for the innovation and discovery we need to meet the 
			digital challenges of our time.&nbsp;And that's why my Administration is 
			making major investments in our information infrastructure:&nbsp;laying 
			broadband lines to every corner of America; building a smart 
			electric grid to deliver energy more efficiently; pursuing a next 
			generation of air traffic control systems; and moving to electronic 
			health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save 
			lives.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, we will 
			begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and 
			digital literacy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build 
			a digital workforce for the 21st century.&nbsp;And that's why we're 
			making a new commitment to education in math and science, and 
			historic investments in science and research and development. 
			Because it's not enough for our children and students to master 
			today's technologies -- social networking and e-mailing and texting 
			and blogging -- we need them to pioneer the technologies that will 
			allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to 
			prosper in the future.&nbsp;So these are the things we will do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me also be clear

			I repeat, will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or 
			Internet traffic.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">We will preserve and protect the personal privacy

		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The task I have

			are already online, and more are logging on every day.&nbsp;Groups and 
			governments are sharpening their cyber capabilities.&nbsp;Protecting our 
			prosperity and security in this globalized world is going to be a 
			long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over 
			many years.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we need to 
			remember:&nbsp;We're only at the beginning. The epochs of history are

			comparison, our Information Age is still in its infancy.&nbsp;We're only 
			at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">

			transform our lives in ways we can't even begin to imagine.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So a new world awaits 
			-- a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity -- 
			if we reach for it, if we lead.&nbsp;So long as I'm President of the 
			United States, we will do just that. And the United States -- the 
			nation that invented the Internet, that launched an information 
			revolution, that transformed the world -- will do what we did in the 
			20th century and lead once more in the 21st.</font></div>
