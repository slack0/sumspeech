		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you very much, 
		everybody, and I very much appreciate your patience. I want to, first of 
		all, thank
		<a href="https://www.americanambassadors.org/members/joseph-b-gildenhorn">
		<font color="#0000FF">Ambassador Gildenhorn</font></a> for the 
		outstanding work he does as board chairman here at the
		<a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/"><font color="#0000FF">Woodrow 
		Wilson Center</font></a>, and to my great friend
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_H._Hamilton">
		<font color="#0000FF">Lee Hamilton</font></a>, who is, I think, an 
		example of what's best in American public service, and has done so much 
		to not only promote American interests all across the globe but also to 
		educate the American people on our foreign policy. So, thank you very 
		much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Sixty-one years ago, George 
		Marshal announced <a href="../georgecmarshall.html">
		<font color="#0000FF"><a href="../georgecmarshall.html">
		<font color="#0000FF">the plan</font></a> that would 
		come to bear his name</font></a>. Much of Europe lay in ruins. The United States 
		faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination. This 
		menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy 
		life on an unimaginable scale. The Soviet Union didn't yet have an 
		atomic bomb, but before long it would.</font></p>
		<div id="body_after_content_column">
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The challenge facing the greatest generation of Americans -- the 
			generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield -- was how 
			to contain this threat while extending freedom's frontiers. Leaders 
			like Truman and Acheson, Kennan and Marshall, knew that there was no 
			single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom. We needed a 
			new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and 
			dangerous world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Such a strategy would join overwhelming military 
			strength with sound judgment. It would shape events not just through 
			military force, but through the force of our ideas; through economic 
			power, intelligence and diplomacy. It would support strong allies 
			that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy; open markets 
			and the rule of law. It would foster new international institutions 
			like the United Nations, NATO, and the World Bank, and focus on 
			every corner of the globe. It was a strategy that saw clearly the 
			world's dangers, while seizing its promise.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a general, Marshall had spent years helping FDR wage war. But 
			the Marshall Plan -- which was just one part of this strategy -- 
			helped rebuild not just allies, but also the nation that Marshall 
			had plotted to defeat. In the speech announcing his plan, he 
			concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations -- but 
			rather with questions and a call for perspective. &quot;The whole world 
			of the future,&quot; Marshall said, &quot;hangs on a proper judgment.&quot; To make 
			that judgment, he asked the American people to examine distant 
			events that directly affected their security and prosperity. He 
			closed by asking: &quot;What is needed? What can best be done? What must 
			be done?&quot; </font> </p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Today's dangers are different, though no less grave. The power to 
			destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the 
			hands of terrorists. The future of our security -- and our planet -- 
			is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas. From the 
			cave- spotted mountains of northwest Pakistan, to the centrifuges 
			spinning beneath Iranian soil, we know that the American people 
			cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military 
			alone.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The attacks of September 11 brought this new reality into a 
			terrible and ominous focus. On that bright and beautiful day, the 
			world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our Cold War 
			victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble, and twisted steel, 
			and clouds of smoke.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and 
			determination of our nation. At blood banks and vigils; in schools 
			and in the United States Congress, Americans were united -- more 
			united, even, than we were at the dawn of the Cold War. The world, 
			too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old 
			allies, new friends, and even long-time adversaries stood by our 
			side. It was time -- once again -- for America's might and moral 
			suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new 
			security strategy for an ever-changing world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Imagine, for a moment, what we could have done in those days, and 
			months, and years after 9/11.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have deployed the full force of American power to hunt 
			down and destroy Osama bin Laden, Al Qaida, the Taliban, and all of 
			the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security 
			in Afghanistan.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world, 
			and updated a 20th century non-proliferation framework to meet the 
			challenges of the 21st.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in 
			alternative sources of energy to grow our economy, save our planet, 
			and end the tyranny of oil.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have strengthened old alliances, formed new 
			partnerships, and renewed international institutions to advance 
			peace and prosperity.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have called on a new generation to step into the strong 
			currents of history, and to serve their country as troops and 
			teachers, Peace Corps volunteers and police officers.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have secured our homeland -- investing in sophisticated 
			new protection for our ports, our trains and our power plants.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have rebuilt our roads and bridges, laid down new rail 
			and broadband and electricity systems, and made college affordable 
			for every American to strengthen our ability to compete.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have done that.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead, we have lost thousands of American lives, spent nearly a 
			trillion dollars, alienated allies and neglected emerging threats -- 
			all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a 
			country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we 
			have given them. What's missing in our debate about Iraq -- what has 
			been missing since before the war began -- is a discussion of the 
			strategic consequences of Iraq and its dominance of our foreign 
			policy. This war distracts us from every threat that we face and so 
			many opportunities we could seize. This war diminishes our security, 
			our standing in the world, our military, our economy, and the 
			resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st 
			century. By any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on 
			Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am running for President of the United States to lead this 
			country in a new direction -- to seize this moment's promise. 
			Instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we 
			face, I want to overcome them. Instead of pushing the entire burden 
			of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military, 
			I want to use all elements of American power to keep us safe, and 
			prosperous, and free. Instead of alienating ourselves from the 
			world, I want America -- once again -- to lead.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As President, I will pursue a tough, smart and principled 
			national security strategy -- one that recognizes that we have 
			interests not just in Baghdad, but in Kandahar and Karachi, in Tokyo 
			and London, in Beijing and Berlin. I will focus this strategy on 
			five goals essential to making America safer: ending the war in Iraq 
			responsibly; finishing the fight against Al Qaida and the Taliban; 
			securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue 
			states; achieving true energy security; and rebuilding our alliances 
			to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">My opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor, 
			and we all respect his sacrifice. We both want to do what we think 
			is best to defend the American people. But we've made different 
			judgments, and would lead in very different directions. That starts 
			with Iraq.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I opposed going to war in Iraq; Senator McCain was one of 
			Washington's biggest supporters for war. I warned that the invasion 
			of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of 
			extremism, and distract us from the fight against Al Qaida and the 
			Taliban; Senator McCain claimed that we would be greeted as 
			liberators, and that democracy would spread across the Middle East. 
			Those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic 
			question since the end of the Cold War.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, all of us recognize that we must do more than look back -- 
			we must make a judgment about how to move forward. What is needed? 
			What can best be done? What must be done? Senator McCain wants to 
			talk of our tactics in Iraq; I want to focus on a new strategy for 
			Iraq and the wider world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It has been 18 months since President Bush announced the surge. 
			As I have said many times, our troops have performed brilliantly in 
			lowering the level of violence. General Petraeus has used new 
			tactics to protect the Iraqi population. We have talked directly to 
			Sunni tribes that used to be hostile to America, and supported their 
			fight against Al Qaida. Shiite militias have generally respected a 
			cease- fire. Those are the facts, and all Americans welcome them.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For weeks, now, Senator McCain has argued that the gains of the 
			surge mean that I should change my commitment to end the war. But 
			this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in Iraq, and 
			stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that 
			we face.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 18 months since the surge began, the strain on our 
			military has increased, our troops and their families have borne an 
			enormous burden, and American taxpayers have spent another $200 
			billion in Iraq. That's over $10 billion each month. That is a 
			consequence of our current strategy.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in 
			Afghanistan has deteriorated. June was our highest casualty month of 
			the war. The Taliban has been on the offensive, even launching a 
			brazen attack on one of our bases. Al Qaida has a growing sanctuary 
			in Pakistan. That is a consequence of our current strategy.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 18 months since the surge began, as I warned at the outset 
			-- Iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the 
			purpose of the surge. They have not invested tens of billions of 
			dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country. They have not 
			resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">That's why I strongly stand by my plan to end this war. Now, 
			Prime Minister Maliki's call for a timetable for the removal of U.S. 
			forces presents a real opportunity. It comes at a time when the 
			American general in charge of training Iraq's Security Forces has 
			testified that Iraq's Army and Police will be ready to assume 
			responsibility for Iraq's security in 2009. Now is the time for a 
			responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes Iraq's 
			leaders toward a political solution, rebuilds our military, and 
			refocuses on Afghanistan and our broader security interests.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">George Bush and John McCain don't have a strategy for success in 
			Iraq -- they have a strategy for staying in Iraq. They said we 
			couldn't leave when violence was up, they say we can't leave when 
			violence is down. They refuse to press the Iraqis to make tough 
			choices, and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops 
			&quot;surrender,&quot; even though we would be turning Iraq over to a 
			sovereign Iraqi government -- not to a terrorist enemy. Theirs is an 
			endless focus on tactics inside Iraq, with no consideration of our 
			strategy to face threats beyond Iraq's borders.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">At some point, a judgment must be made. Iraq is not going to be a 
			perfect place, and we don't have unlimited resources to try to make 
			it one. We are not going to kill every Al Qaida sympathizer, 
			eliminate every trace of Iranian influence, or stand up a flawless 
			democracy before we leave -- General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker 
			acknowledged this to me when they testified last April. That is why 
			the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a 
			failed policy. In fact, true success in Iraq -- victory in Iraq -- 
			will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down 
			their arms. True success will take place when we leave Iraq to a 
			government that is taking responsibility for its future -- a 
			government that prevents sectarian conflict, and ensures that the Al 
			Qaida threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not 
			reemerge. That is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive 
			plan to press the Iraqis stand up.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To achieve that success, I will give our military a new mission 
			on my first day in office: ending this war. Let me be clear: we must 
			be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in. We 
			can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove 
			them in 16 months. That would be the summer of 2010 -- one year 
			after Iraqi Security Forces will be prepared to stand up; two years 
			from now, and more than seven years after the war began. After this 
			redeployment, we'll keep a residual force to perform specific 
			missions in Iraq: targeting any remnants of Al Qaida; protecting our 
			service members and diplomats; and training and supporting Iraq's 
			Security Forces, so long as the Iraqis make political progress.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy 
			-- that is what any responsible Commander-in-Chief must do. As I 
			have consistently said, I will consult with commanders on the ground 
			and the Iraqi government. We will redeploy from secure areas first 
			and volatile areas later. We will commit $2 billion to a meaningful 
			international effort to support the more than 4 million displaced 
			Iraqis. We will forge a new coalition to support Iraq's future -- 
			one that includes all of Iraq's neighbors, and also the United 
			Nations, the World Bank, and the European Union -- because we all 
			have a stake in stability. And we will make it clear that the United 
			States seeks no permanent bases in Iraq.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the future that Iraqis want. This is the future that the 
			American people want. And this is what our common interests demand. 
			Both America and Iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in 
			Anbar is taken out by the Iraqi Army, and the criminal in Baghdad 
			fears Iraqi Police, not just coalition forces. Both America and Iraq 
			will succeed when every Arab government has an embassy open in 
			Baghdad, and the child in Basra benefits from services provided by 
			Iraqi dinars, not American tax dollars.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And this is the future we need for our military. We cannot 
			tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that hasn't made 
			us safer. I will restore our strength by ending this war, completing 
			the increase of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 
			marines, and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat 
			conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our 
			time.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So let's be clear. Senator McCain would have our troops continue 
			to fight tour after tour of duty, and our taxpayers keep spending 
			$10 billion a month indefinitely; I want Iraqis to take 
			responsibility for their own future, and to reach the political 
			accommodation necessary for long-term stability. That's victory. 
			That's success. That's what's best for Iraq, that's what's best for 
			America, and that's why I will end this war as President.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In fact -- as should have been apparent to President Bush and 
			Senator McCain -- the central front in the war on terror is not 
			Iraq, and it never was. That's why the second goal of my new 
			strategy will be taking the fight to Al Qaida in Afghanistan and 
			Pakistan.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3,000 
			Americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who attacked us on 
			9/11 are still at large. Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahari are 
			recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror. The 
			Taliban controls parts of Afghanistan. Al Qaida has an expanding 
			base in Pakistan that is probably no farther from their old Afghan 
			sanctuary than a train ride from Washington to Philadelphia. If 
			another attack on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the 
			same region where 9/11 was planned. And yet today, we have five 
			times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Senator McCain said -- just months ago -- that &quot;Afghanistan is 
			not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq.&quot; I could not 
			disagree more. Our troops and our NATO allies are performing 
			heroically in Afghanistan, but I have argued for years that we lack 
			the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to Iraq. 
			That's what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier 
			this month. And that's why, as President, I will make the fight 
			against Al Qaida and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. 
			This is a war that we have to win.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I will send at least two additional combat brigades to 
			Afghanistan, and use this commitment to seek greater contributions 
			-- with fewer restrictions -- from NATO allies. I will focus on 
			training Afghan security forces and supporting an Afghan judiciary, 
			with more resources and incentives for American officers who perform 
			these missions. Just as we succeeded in the Cold War by supporting 
			allies who could sustain their own security, we must realize that 
			the 21st century's front lines are not only on the field of battle 
			-- they are found in the training exercise near Kabul, in the police 
			station in Kandahar, and in the rule of law in Herat.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Moreover, lasting security will only come if we heed Marshall's 
			lesson, and help Afghans grow their economy from the bottom up. 
			That's why I've proposed an additional $1 billion in non-military 
			assistance each year, with meaningful safeguards to prevent 
			corruption and to make sure investments are made -- not just in 
			Kabul -- but out in Afghanistan's provinces. As a part of this 
			program, we'll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy-growing 
			for Afghan farmers, just as we crack down on heroin trafficking. We 
			cannot lose Afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism. The Afghan 
			people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring, 
			because the security of Afghanistan and the United States is shared.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions 
			of Pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into 
			Afghanistan. We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and as 
			President, I won't. We need a stronger and sustained partnership 
			between Afghanistan, Pakistan and NATO to secure the border, to take 
			out terrorist camps, and to crack down on cross-border insurgents. 
			We need more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more 
			Predator drones in the Afghan border region. And we must make it 
			clear that if Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out 
			high-level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our 
			sights.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Make no mistake: we can't succeed in Afghanistan or secure our 
			homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy. We must expect more 
			of the Pakistani government, but we must offer more than a blank 
			check to a General who has lost the confidence of his people. It's 
			time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of 
			the Pakistani people. That's why I'm cosponsoring a bill with Joe 
			Biden and Richard Lugar to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani 
			people and to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the 
			military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the 
			Taliban and Al Qaida. We must move beyond a purely military alliance 
			built on convenience, or face mounting popular opposition in a 
			nuclear-armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical Islam.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Only a strong Pakistani democracy can help us move toward my 
			third goal -- securing all nuclear weapons and materials from 
			terrorists and rogue states. One of the terrible ironies of the Iraq 
			War is that President Bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to 
			invade a country that had no active nuclear program. But the fact 
			that the President misled us into a misguided war doesn't diminish 
			the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction -- in 
			fact, it has only increased it.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In those years after World War II, we worried about the deadly 
			atom falling into the hands of the Kremlin. Now, we worry about 50 
			tons of highly enriched uranium -- some of it poorly secured -- at 
			civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries. Now, we worry 
			about the breakdown of a non-proliferation framework that was 
			designed for the bipolar world of the Cold War. Now, we worry -- 
			most of all -- about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring 
			the world's deadliest weapons to the world's most dangerous people: 
			terrorists who won't think twice about killing themselves and 
			hundreds of thousands in Tel Aviv or Moscow, in London or New York.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We cannot wait any longer to protect the American people. I've 
			made this a priority in the Senate, where I worked with Republican 
			Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose 
			nuclear materials. I'll lead a global effort to secure all loose 
			nuclear materials around the world during my first term as 
			President. And I'll develop new defenses to protect against the 21st 
			century threat of biological weapons and cyber-terrorism -- threats 
			that I'll discuss in more detail tomorrow.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Beyond taking these immediate, urgent steps, it's time to send a 
			clear message: America seeks a world with no nuclear weapons. As 
			long as nuclear weapons exist, we must retain a strong deterrent. 
			But instead of threatening to kick them out of the G-8, we need to 
			work with Russia to take U.S. and Russian ballistic missiles off 
			hair- trigger alert; to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our 
			nuclear weapons and material; to seek a global ban on the production 
			of fissile material for weapons; and to expand the U.S.-Russian ban 
			on intermediate-range missiles so that the agreement is global. By 
			keeping our commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
			we'll be in a better position to press nations like North Korea and 
			Iran to keep theirs. In particular, it will give us more credibility 
			and leverage in dealing with Iran.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that 
			support terror. Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is a 
			vital national security interest of the United States. No tool of 
			statecraft should be taken off the table, but Senator McCain would 
			continue a failed policy that has seen Iran strengthen its position, 
			advance its nuclear program, and stockpile 150 kilos of low enriched 
			uranium. I will use all elements of American power to pressure the 
			Iranian regime, starting with aggressive, principled and direct 
			diplomacy -- diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without 
			preconditions.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There will be careful preparation. I commend the work of our 
			European allies on this important matter, and we should be full 
			partners in that effort. Ultimately the measure of any effort is 
			whether it leads to a change in Iranian behavior. That's why we must 
			pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our 
			allies, bringing to bear our full influence -- including, if it will 
			advance our interests, my meeting with the appropriate Iranian 
			leader at a time and place of my choosing.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the Iranian 
			regime. Instead, we will present a clear choice. If you abandon your 
			nuclear program, support for terror, and threats to Israel, there 
			will be meaningful incentives. If you refuse, then we will ratchet 
			up the pressure, with stronger unilateral sanctions; stronger 
			multilateral sanctions in the Security Council, and sustained action 
			outside the UN to isolate the Iranian regime. That's the diplomacy 
			we need. And the Iranians should negotiate now; by waiting, they 
			will only face mounting pressure.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The surest way to increase our leverage against Iran in the long- 
			run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions. That will depend on 
			achieving my fourth goal: ending the tyranny of oil in our time.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price 
			of oil. We ship nearly $700 million a day to unstable or hostile 
			nations for their oil. It pays for terrorist bombs going off from 
			Baghdad to Beirut. It funds petro-diplomacy in Caracas and radical 
			madrasas from Karachi to Khartoum. It takes leverage away from 
			America and shifts it to dictators.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This immediate danger is eclipsed only by the long-term threat 
			from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather 
			patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine. That means people 
			competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very 
			places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: Africa, 
			the Middle East, and South Asia. Most disastrously, that could mean 
			destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our 
			coastline.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern -- 
			this is a national security crisis. For the sake of our security -- 
			and for every American family that is paying the price at the pump 
			-- we must end this dependence on foreign oil. And as President, 
			that's exactly what I'll do. Small steps and political gimmickry 
			just won't do. I'll invest $150 billion over the next ten years to 
			put America on the path to true energy security. This fund will fast 
			track investments in a new green energy business sector that will 
			end our addiction to oil and create up to 5 million jobs over the 
			next two decades, and help secure the future of our country and our 
			planet. We'll invest in research and development of every form of 
			alternative energy -- solar, wind, and biofuels, as well as 
			technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe. And 
			from the moment I take office, I will let it be known that the 
			United States of America is ready to lead again.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Never again will we sit on the sidelines, or stand in the way of 
			global action to tackle this global challenge. I will reach out to 
			the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to 
			join a new Global Energy Forum that will lay the foundation for the 
			next generation of climate protocols. We will also build an alliance 
			of oil-importing nations and work together to reduce our demand, and 
			to break the grip of OPEC on the global economy. We'll set a goal of 
			an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050. And as we develop new 
			forms of clean energy here at home, we will share our technology and 
			our innovations with all the nations of the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">That is the tradition of American leadership on behalf of the 
			global good. And that will be my fifth goal -- rebuilding our 
			alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For all of our power, America is strongest when we act alongside 
			strong partners. We faced down fascism with the greatest war-time 
			alliance the world has ever known. We stood shoulder to shoulder 
			with our NATO allies against the Soviet threat, and paid a far 
			smaller price for the first Gulf War because we acted together with 
			a broad coalition. We helped create the United Nations -- not to 
			constrain America's influence, but to amplify it by advancing our 
			values.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now is the time for a new era of international cooperation. It's 
			time for America and Europe to renew our common commitment to face 
			down the threats of the 21st century just as we did the challenges 
			of the 20th. It's time to strengthen our partnerships with Japan, 
			South Korea, Australia and the world's largest democracy -- India -- 
			to create a stable and prosperous Asia. It's time to engage China on 
			common interests like climate change, even as we continue to 
			encourage their shift to a more open and market-based society. It's 
			time to strengthen NATO by asking more of our allies, while always 
			approaching them with the respect owed a partner. It's time to 
			reform the United Nations, so that this imperfect institution can 
			become a more perfect forum to share burdens, strengthen our 
			leverage, and promote our values. It's time to deepen our engagement 
			to help resolve the Arab- Israeli conflict, so that we help our ally 
			Israel achieve true and lasting security, while helping Palestinians 
			achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And just as we renew longstanding efforts, so must we shape new 
			ones to meet new challenges. That's why I'll create a Shared 
			Security Partnership Program -- a new alliance of nations to 
			strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist 
			networks, while standing up against torture and brutality. That's 
			why we'll work with the African Union to enhance its ability to keep 
			the peace. That's why we'll build a new partnership to roll back the 
			trafficking of drugs, and guns, and gangs in the Americas. That's 
			what we can do if we are ready to engage the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical 
			priorities. I know development assistance is not the most popular 
			program, but as President, I will make the case to the American 
			people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common 
			security of the entire world. That was true with the Marshall Plan, 
			and that must be true today. That's why I'll double our foreign 
			assistance to $50 billion by 2012, and use it to support a stable 
			future in failing states, and sustainable growth in Africa; to halve 
			global poverty and to roll back disease. To send once more a message 
			to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, &quot;You matter to 
			us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.&quot;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This must be the moment when we answer the call of history. For 
			eight years, we have paid the price for a foreign policy that 
			lectures without listening; that divides us from one another -- and 
			from the world -- instead of calling us to a common purpose; that 
			focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in Iraq instead 
			of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we 
			face. We cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of 
			balance and out of step with this defining moment. None of this will 
			be easy, but we have faced great odds before. When General Marshall 
			first spoke about the plan that would bear his name, the rubble of 
			Berlin had not yet been built into a wall. But Marshall knew that 
			even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship 
			founded in freedom. He had the confidence to know that the purpose 
			and pragmatism of the American people could outlast any foe. Today, 
			the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the Cold War 
			have receded. Now, the defeat of the threats of the past has been 
			replaced by the transnational threats of today. We know what is 
			needed. We know what can best be done. We know what must done. Now 
			it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism 
			as an earlier generation, to join with friends and partners to lead 
			the world anew.</font></div>
