		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good morning. It is an honor 
		for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around 
		the world. We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a 
		grave and growing danger to our people. All of you would not be here 
		unless you -- like me -- were convinced that this danger is real. This 
		is not fiction, it is science. Unchecked, climate change will pose 
		unacceptable risks to our security, our economies, and our planet. This 
		much we know.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The question, then, before 
		us is no longer the nature of the challenge. The question is our 
		capacity to meet it. For while the reality of climate change is not in 
		doubt, I have to be honest, as the world watches us today, I think our 
		ability to take collective action is in doubt right now, and it hangs in 
		the balance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe we can act boldly, 
		and decisively, in the face of a common threat. That's why I come here 
		today -- not to talk, but to act.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, as the world's largest 
		economy and as the world's second largest emitter, America bears our 
		responsibility to address climate change, and we intend to meet that 
		responsibility. That's why we've renewed our leadership within 
		international climate change negotiations. That's why we've worked with 
		other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. That's why we've taken 
		bold action at home -- by making historic investments in renewable 
		energy; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes 
		and buildings; and by pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to 
		a clean energy economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These mitigation actions are 
		ambitious, and we are taking them not simply to meet global 
		responsibilities. We are convinced, as some of you may be convinced, 
		that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to 
		America's economic future -- that it will create millions of new jobs, 
		power new industries, keep us competitive, and spark new innovation. 
		We're convinced, for our own self-interest, that the way we use energy, 
		changing it to a more efficient fashion, is essential to our national 
		security, because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and 
		helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So I want this plenary 
		session to understand, America is going to continue on this course of 
		action to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy 
		economy, no matter what happens here in Copenhagen. We think it is good 
		for us, as well as good for the world. But we also believe that we will 
		all be stronger, all be safer, all be more secure if we act together. 
		That's why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in 
		which we agree to certain steps, and to hold each other accountable to 
		certain commitments.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After months of talk, after 
		two weeks of negotiations, after innumerable side meetings, bilateral 
		meetings, endless hours of discussion among negotiators, I believe that 
		the pieces of that accord should now be clear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, all major economies 
		must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their 
		emissions, and begin to turn the corner on climate change. I'm pleased 
		that many of us have already done so. Almost all the major economies 
		have put forward legitimate targets, significant targets, ambitious 
		targets. And I'm confident that America will fulfill the commitments 
		that we have made: cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 
		2020, and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final 
		legislation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Second, we must have a 
		mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, and exchange 
		this information in a transparent manner. These measures need not be 
		intrusive, or infringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that 
		an accord is credible, and that we're living up to our obligations. 
		Without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on a 
		page.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know how you have an 
		international agreement where we all are not sharing information and 
		ensuring that we are meeting our commitments. That doesn't make sense. 
		It would be a hollow victory.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Number three, we must have 
		financing that helps developing countries adapt, particularly the least 
		developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change. America will 
		be a part of fast-start funding that will ramp up to $10 billion by 
		2012. And yesterday, Secretary Hillary Clinton, my Secretary of State, 
		made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $100 
		billion in financing by 2020, if -- and only if -- it is part of a 
		broader accord that I have just described.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mitigation. Transparency. 
		Financing. It's a clear formula -- one that embraces the principle of 
		common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities. And it 
		adds up to a significant accord -- one that takes us farther than we 
		have ever gone before as an international community.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I just want to say to this 
		plenary session that we are running short on time. And at this point, 
		the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart, 
		whether we prefer posturing to action. I'm sure that many consider this 
		an imperfect framework that I just described. No country will get 
		everything that it wants. There are those developing countries that want 
		aid with no strings attached, and no obligations with respect to 
		transparency. They think that the most advanced nations should pay a 
		higher price. I understand that. There are those advanced nations who 
		think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance, or 
		that will not be held accountable effectively, and that the world's 
		fastest-growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We know the fault lines 
		because we've been imprisoned by them for years. These international 
		discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades, and 
		we have very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration 
		of the climate change phenomenon. The time for talk is over. This is the 
		bottom line: We can embrace this accord, take a substantial step 
		forward, continue to refine it and build upon its foundation. We can do 
		that, and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic 
		endeavor -- one that makes life better for our children and our 
		grandchildren.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or we can choose delay, 
		falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of 
		action for years. And we will be back having the same stale arguments 
		month after month, year after year, perhaps decade after decade, all 
		while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ladies and gentlemen, there 
		is no time to waste. America has made our choice. We have charted our 
		course. We have made our commitments. We will do what we say. Now I 
		believe it's the time for the nations and the people of the world to 
		come together behind a common purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are ready to get this 
		done today -- but there has to be movement on all sides to recognize 
		that it is better for us to act than to talk; it’s better for us to 
		choose action over inaction; the future over the past -- and with 
		courage and faith, I believe that we can meet our responsibility to our 
		people, and the future of our planet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much.</font></p>
