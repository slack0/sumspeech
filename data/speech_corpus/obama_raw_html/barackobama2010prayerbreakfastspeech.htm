		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp;Thank you very 
		much.&nbsp;Please be seated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much.&nbsp;Heads of 
		state, Cabinet members, my outstanding Vice President, members of 
		Congress, religious leaders, distinguished guests, Admiral Mullen -- 
		it's good to see all of you. Let me begin by acknowledging the co-chairs 
		of this breakfast, Senators Isakson and Klobuchar, who embody the sense 
		of fellowship at the heart of this gathering. They're two of my favorite 
		senators. Let me also acknowledge the director of my faith-based office, 
		Joshua DuBois, who is here.&nbsp;Where's Joshua?&nbsp;He's out there 
		somewhere.&nbsp;He's doing great work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to commend Secretary 
		Hillary Clinton on her outstanding remarks, and her outstanding 
		leadership at the State Department.&nbsp;She's doing good every day.&nbsp;I'm 
		especially pleased to see my dear friend, Prime Minister Zapatero, and I 
		want him to relay America's greetings to the people of Spain.&nbsp;And 
		Johnny, you are right, I'm deeply blessed, and I thank God every day for 
		being married to Michelle Obama.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm privileged to join you 
		once again, as my predecessors have for over half a century.&nbsp;Like them, 
		I come here to speak about the ways my faith informs who I am -- as a 
		President, and as a person.&nbsp;But I'm also here for the same reason that 
		all of you are, for we all share a recognition -- one as old as time -- 
		that a willingness to believe, an openness to grace, a commitment to 
		prayer can bring sustenance to our lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is, of course, a need 
		for prayer even in times of joy and peace and prosperity.&nbsp;Perhaps 
		especially in such times prayer is needed -- to guard against pride and 
		to guard against complacency.&nbsp;But rightly or wrongly, most of us are 
		inclined to seek out the divine not in the moment when the Lord makes 
		His face shine upon us, but in moments when God's grace can seem 
		farthest away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last month, God's grace, 
		God's mercy, seemed far away from our neighbors in Haiti.&nbsp;And yet I 
		believe that grace was not absent in the midst of tragedy.&nbsp;It was heard 
		in prayers and hymns that broke the silence of an earthquake's wake.&nbsp;It 
		was witnessed among parishioners of churches that stood no more, a 
		roadside congregation, holding bibles in their laps.&nbsp;It was felt in the 
		presence of relief workers and medics; translators; servicemen and 
		women, bringing water and food and aid to the injured.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One such translator was an 
		American of Haitian descent, representative of the extraordinary work 
		that our men and women in uniform do all around the world -- Navy 
		Corpsman Christian [sic] Brossard.&nbsp;And lying on a gurney aboard the USNS 
		Comfort, a woman asked Christopher:&nbsp; &quot;Where do you come from?&nbsp; What 
		country?&nbsp; After my operation,&quot; she said, &quot;I will pray for that 
		country.&quot;&nbsp;And in Creole, Corpsman Brossard responded, &quot;Etazini.&quot;&nbsp;The 
		United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God's grace, and the 
		compassion and decency of the American people is expressed through the 
		men and women like Corpsman Brossard.&nbsp;It's expressed through the efforts 
		of our Armed Forces, through the efforts of our entire government, 
		through similar efforts from Spain and other countries around the 
		world.&nbsp;It's also, as Secretary Clinton said, expressed through multiple 
		faith-based efforts.&nbsp;By evangelicals at World Relief.&nbsp;By the American 
		Jewish World Service.&nbsp;By Hindu temples, and mainline Protestants, 
		Catholic Relief Services, African American churches, the United 
		Sikhs.&nbsp;By Americans of every faith, and no faith, uniting around a 
		common purpose, a higher purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's inspiring.&nbsp;This is what 
		we do, as Americans, in times of trouble.&nbsp;We unite, recognizing that 
		such crises call on all of us to act, recognizing that there but for the 
		grace of God go I, recognizing that life's most sacred responsibility -- 
		one affirmed, as Hillary said, by all of the world's great religions -- 
		is to sacrifice something of ourselves for a person in need.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sadly, though, that spirit 
		is too often absent when tackling the long-term, but no less profound 
		issues facing our country and the world.&nbsp;Too often, that spirit is 
		missing without the spectacular tragedy, the 9/11 or the Katrina, the 
		earthquake or the tsunami, that can shake us out of complacency.&nbsp;We 
		become numb to the day-to-day crises, the slow-moving tragedies of 
		children without food and men without shelter and families without 
		health care.&nbsp;We become absorbed with our abstract arguments, our 
		ideological disputes, our contests for power.&nbsp;And in this Tower of 
		Babel, we lose the sound of God's voice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for those of us here in 
		Washington, let's acknowledge that democracy has always been 
		messy.&nbsp;Let's not be overly nostalgic.&nbsp;Divisions are hardly new in this 
		country. Arguments about the proper role of government, the relationship 
		between liberty and equality, our obligations to our fellow citizens -- 
		these things have been with us since our founding.&nbsp;And I'm profoundly 
		mindful that a loyal opposition, a vigorous back and forth, a skepticism 
		of power, all of that is what makes our democracy work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we've seen actually some 
		improvement in some circumstances.&nbsp;We haven't seen any canings on the 
		floor of the Senate any time recently.&nbsp;So we shouldn't over-romanticize 
		the past.&nbsp; But there is a sense that something is different now; that 
		something is broken; that those of us in Washington are not serving the 
		people as well as we should.&nbsp;At times, it seems like we're unable to 
		listen to one another; to have at once a serious and civil debate.&nbsp;And 
		this erosion of civility in the public square sows division and distrust 
		among our citizens.&nbsp;It poisons the well of public opinion.&nbsp;It leaves 
		each side little room to negotiate with the other.&nbsp;It makes politics an 
		all-or-nothing sport, where one side is either always right or always 
		wrong when, in reality, neither side has a monopoly on truth.&nbsp;And then 
		we lose sight of the children without food and the men without shelter 
		and the families without health care.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Empowered by faith, 
		consistently, prayerfully, we need to find our way back to 
		civility.&nbsp;That begins with stepping out of our comfort zones in an 
		effort to bridge divisions.&nbsp;We see that in many conservative pastors who 
		are helping lead the way to fix our broken immigration system.&nbsp; It's not 
		what would be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in those 
		immigrant families, the face of God.&nbsp;We see that in the evangelical 
		leaders who are rallying their congregations to protect our planet.&nbsp;We 
		see it in the increasing recognition among progressives that government 
		can't solve all of our problems, and that talking about values like 
		responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any 
		anti-poverty agenda. Stretching out of our dogmas, our prescribed roles 
		along the political spectrum, that can help us regain a sense of 
		civility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Civility also requires 
		relearning how to disagree without being disagreeable; understanding, as 
		President [Kennedy] said, that &quot;civility is not a sign of weakness.&quot; 
		Now, I am the first to confess I am not always right.&nbsp;Michelle will 
		testify to that.&nbsp;But surely you can question my policies without 
		questioning my faith, or, for that matter, my citizenship.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Challenging each other's 
		ideas can renew our democracy.&nbsp;But when we challenge each other's 
		motives, it becomes harder to see what we hold in common.&nbsp;We forget that 
		we share at some deep level the same dreams -- even when we don't share 
		the same plans on how to fulfill them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We may disagree about the 
		best way to reform our health care system, but surely we can agree that 
		no one ought to go broke when they get sick in the richest nation on 
		Earth. We can take different approaches to ending inequality, but surely 
		we can agree on the need to lift our children out of ignorance; to lift 
		our neighbors from poverty.&nbsp;We may disagree about gay marriage, but 
		surely we can agree that it is unconscionable to target gays and 
		lesbians for who they are -- whether it's here in the United States or, 
		as Hillary mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are being 
		proposed most recently in Uganda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Surely we can agree to find 
		common ground when possible, parting ways when necessary.&nbsp;But in doing 
		so, let us be guided by our faith, and by prayer.&nbsp; For while prayer can 
		buck us up when we are down, keep us calm in a storm; while prayer can 
		stiffen our spines to surmount an obstacle -- and I assure you I'm 
		praying a lot these days -- prayer can also do something else.&nbsp; It can 
		touch our hearts with humility.&nbsp;It can fill us with a spirit of 
		brotherhood.&nbsp;It can remind us that each of us are children of a awesome 
		and loving God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through faith, but not 
		through faith alone, we can unite people to serve the common good.&nbsp;And 
		that's why my Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has 
		been working so hard since I announced it here last year.&nbsp;We've slashed 
		red tape and built effective partnerships on a range of uses, from 
		promoting fatherhood here at home to spearheading interfaith cooperation 
		abroad.&nbsp;And through that office we've turned the faith-based initiative 
		around to find common ground among people of all beliefs, allowing them 
		to make an impact in a way that's civil and respectful of difference and 
		focused on what matters most.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is this spirit of 
		civility that we are called to take up when we leave here today.&nbsp;That's 
		what I'm praying for.&nbsp; I know in difficult times like these -- when 
		people are frustrated, when pundits start shouting and politicians start 
		calling each other names -- it can seem like a return to civility is not 
		possible, like the very idea is a relic of some bygone era.&nbsp;The word 
		itself seems quaint -- civility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let us remember those 
		who came before; those who believed in the brotherhood of man even when 
		such a faith was tested.&nbsp;Remember Dr. Martin Luther King.&nbsp;Not long after 
		an explosion ripped through his front porch, his wife and infant 
		daughter inside, he rose to that pulpit in Montgomery and said, &quot;Love is 
		the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the eyes of those who 
		denied his humanity, he saw the face of God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember Abraham Lincoln. On 
		the eve of the Civil War, with states seceding and forces gathering, 
		with a nation divided half slave and half free, he rose to deliver his 
		first Inaugural and said, &quot;We are not enemies, but friends…Though 
		passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even in the eyes of 
		confederate soldiers, he saw the face of God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember William 
		Wilberforce, whose Christian faith led him to seek slavery's abolition 
		in Britain; he was vilified, derided, attacked; but he called for 
		&quot;lessening prejudices [and] conciliating good-will, and thereby making 
		way for the less obstructed progress of truth.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the eyes of those who 
		sought to silence a nation's conscience, he saw the face of God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there are crimes of 
		conscience that call us to action.&nbsp;Yes, there are causes that move our 
		hearts and offenses that stir our souls.&nbsp;But progress doesn't come when 
		we demonize opponents.&nbsp; It's not born in righteous spite.&nbsp;Progress comes 
		when we open our hearts, when we extend our hands, when we recognize our 
		common humanity.&nbsp;Progress comes when we look into the eyes of another 
		and see the face of God.&nbsp;That we might do so -- that we will do so all 
		the time, not just some of the time -- is my fervent prayer for our 
		nation and the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, God bless you, 
		and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
