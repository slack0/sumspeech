<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning, everybody. The 
		United States of America is the greatest force for freedom and security 
		that the world has ever known. And in no small measure, that's because 
		we've built the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military in 
		history -- and as Commander-in-Chief, I'm going to keep it that way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, all of us on this 
		stage -- every single one of us -- have a profound responsibility to 
		every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman who puts their 
		life on the line for America. We owe them a strategy with well-defined 
		goals; to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary; 
		to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job 
		done; and to care for them and their families when they come home. That 
		is our solemn obligation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And over the past three 
		years, that's what we've done. We've continued to make historic 
		investments in our military -- our troops and their capabilities, our 
		military families and our veterans. And thanks to their extraordinary 
		service, we've ended our war in Iraq. We've decimated al Qaeda's 
		leadership. We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and we've put 
		that terrorist network on the path to defeat. We've made important 
		progress in Afghanistan, and we've begun to transition so Afghans can 
		assume more responsibility for their own security. We joined allies and 
		partners to protect the Libyan people as they 
		<a href="barackobamaqaddafideath.htm"><font color="#0000FF">ended the regime of 
		Muammar Qaddafi</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we're turning the page 
		on a decade of war. Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq 
		and Afghanistan. Today, we've cut that number in half. And as the 
		transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to 
		come home. More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, 
		forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and 
		human dignity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In short, we've succeeded in 
		defending our nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the 
		number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global 
		leadership. That makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that's an 
		achievement that every American -- especially those Americans who are 
		proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces -- should 
		take great pride in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This success has brought our 
		nation, once more, to a moment of transition. Even as our troops 
		continue to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding. Even as 
		our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity -- and 
		the responsibility -- to look ahead to the force that we are going to 
		need in the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, we have to 
		renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our 
		strength around the world. And that includes putting our fiscal house in 
		order. To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year 
		-- with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike -- mandates 
		reductions in federal spending, including defense spending. I've 
		insisted that we do that responsibly. The security of our nation and the 
		lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I called for this 
		comprehensive defense review -- to clarify our strategic interests in a 
		fast-changing world, and to guide our defense priorities and spending 
		over the coming decade -- because the size and the structure of our 
		military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the 
		other way around. Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history. 
		We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past 
		-- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military was left ill 
		prepared for the future. As Commander in Chief, I will not let that 
		happen again. Not on my watch.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need a start -- we need a smart, strategic set of priorities. The new 
		guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that. 
		I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their 
		extraordinary leadership during this process. I want to thank the 
		service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders and so many 
		defense leaders -- military and civilian, active, Guard and reserve -- 
		for their contributions. Many of us met repeatedly -- asking tough 
		questions, challenging our own assumptions and making hard choices. And 
		we've come together today around an approach that will keep our nation 
		safe and our military the finest that the world have ever known.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This review also benefits 
		from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team 
		-- from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Veterans 
		Affairs, as well as the intelligence community. And this is critical, 
		because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our 
		military alone -- or the United States alone. It requires all elements 
		of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and 
		our partners.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I'm going to let Leon and 
		Marty go into the details. But I just want to say that this effort 
		reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process. 
		Yes, the tide of war is receding. But the question that this strategy 
		answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the 
		last decade are over. And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward 
		from a position of strength.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I made clear in 
		Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, 
		and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical 
		region. We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships 
		and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again -- 
		most recently in Libya -- that it's a force multiplier. We will stay 
		vigilant, especially in the Middle East.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we look beyond the wars 
		in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the end of long-term nation-building with 
		large military footprints -- we'll be able to ensure our security with 
		smaller conventional ground forces. We'll continue to get rid of 
		outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities 
		that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and 
		reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction 
		and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny 
		us access.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, yes, our military will 
		be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to 
		maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, 
		flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We're also going to keep 
		faith with those who serve, by making sure our troops have the equipment 
		and capabilities they need to succeed, and by prioritizing efforts that 
		focus on wounded warriors, mental health and the well-being of our 
		military families. And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, 
		we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefits and job 
		opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, although today is 
		about our defense strategy, I want to close with a word about the 
		defense budget that will flow from this strategy. The details will be 
		announced in the coming weeks. Some will no doubt say that the spending 
		reductions are too big; others will say that they're too small. It will 
		be easy to take issue with a particular change in a particular program. 
		But I'd encourage all of us to remember what 
		<a href="../dwightdeisenhowerfarewell.html"><font color="#0000FF">President Eisenhower once 
		said</font></a> -- that &quot;each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader 
		consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national 
		programs.&quot; After a decade of war, and as we rebuild the source of our 
		strength -- at home and abroad -- it's time to restore that balance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think it's important for 
		all Americans to remember, over the past 10 years, since 9/11, our 
		defense budget grew at an extraordinary pace. Over the next 10 years, 
		the growth in the defense budget will slow, but the fact of the matter 
		is this: It will still grow, because we have global responsibilities 
		that demand our leadership. In fact, the defense budget will still be 
		larger than it was toward the end of the Bush Administration. And I 
		firmly believe, and I think the American people understand, that we can 
		keep our military strong and our nation secure with a defense budget 
		that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So again, I want to thank 
		Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey, all the defense leaders who are on 
		this stage, and some who are absent, for their leadership and their 
		partnership throughout this process. Our men and women in uniform give 
		their very best to America every single day, and in return they deserve 
		the very best from America. And I thank all of you for the commitment to 
		the goal that we all share: keeping America strong and secure in the 
		21st century, and keeping our Armed Forces the very best in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And with that, I will turn 
		this discussion over to Leon and to Marty, who can explain more and take 
		your questions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So thank you very much. I 
		understand this is the first time a President has done this. It's a 
		pretty nice room.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you guys.</font></p>
