		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning, 
		everybody.&nbsp;This morning, I sent a budget to Congress for the coming 
		year.&nbsp;It's a budget that reflects the serious challenges facing the 
		country.&nbsp;We're at war.&nbsp;Our economy has lost 7 million jobs over the last 
		two years.&nbsp;And our government is deeply in debt after what can only be 
		described as a decade of profligacy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact is, 10 years ago, 
		we had a budget surplus of more than $200 billion, with projected 
		surpluses stretching out toward the horizon.&nbsp;Yet over the course of the 
		past 10 years, the previous administration and previous Congresses 
		created an expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts for the 
		wealthy, and funded two wars without paying for any of it -- all of 
		which was compounded by recession and by rising health care costs.&nbsp;As a 
		result, when I first walked through the door, the deficit stood at $1.3 
		trillion, with projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we had taken office 
		during ordinary times, we would have started bringing down these 
		deficits immediately.&nbsp;But one year ago, our country was in crisis:&nbsp;We 
		were losing nearly 700,000 jobs each month, the economy was in a free 
		fall, and the financial system was near collapse.&nbsp;Many feared another 
		Great Depression.&nbsp;So we initiated a rescue, and that rescue was not 
		without significant cost; it added to the deficit as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One year later, because of 
		the steps we've taken, we're in a very different place.&nbsp;But we can't 
		simply move beyond this crisis; we have to address the irresponsibility 
		that led to it.&nbsp;And that includes the failure to rein in spending, as 
		well a reliance on borrowing -- from Wall Street to Washington to Main 
		Street -- to fuel our growth.&nbsp;That's what we have to change.&nbsp;We have to 
		do what families across America are doing:&nbsp;Save where we can so that we 
		can afford what we need.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I think it's very 
		important to understand:&nbsp;We won't be able to bring down this deficit 
		overnight, given that the recovery is still taking hold and families 
		across the country still need help.&nbsp;We will continue, for example, to do 
		what it takes to create jobs.&nbsp;That's reflected in my budget; it's 
		essential.&nbsp;The budget includes new tax cuts for people who invest in 
		small businesses, tax credits for small businesses that hire new 
		workers, investments that will create jobs repairing roads and bridges, 
		and tax breaks for retrofitting homes to save energy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also continue to lay a 
		new foundation for lasting growth, which is essential as well. Just as 
		it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children's future 
		to pay our way today, it would be equally wrong to neglect their future 
		by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success 
		in this new century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why we build on the 
		largest investment in clean energy in history, as well as increase 
		investment in scientific research, so that we are fostering the 
		industries and jobs of the future right here in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I've proposed a 
		more than 6 percent increase in funding for the Education Department.&nbsp; 
		And this funding is tied to reforms that raise student achievement, 
		inspire students to excel in math and science, and turn around failing 
		schools which consign too many young people to a lesser future -- 
		because in the 21st century there is no better anti-poverty program than 
		a world-class education.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why we eliminate 
		a wasteful subsidy to banks that lend to college students, and use that 
		money to revitalize community colleges and make college more 
		affordable.&nbsp;This will help us reach the goal I've set for America:&nbsp;By 
		2020 we will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates 
		in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the investments we 
		must make to create jobs and opportunity now and in the future.&nbsp; And in 
		a departure from the way business had been done in Washington, we 
		actually show how we pay for these investments while putting our country 
		on a more fiscally sustainable path.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've proposed a freeze in 
		government spending for three years.&nbsp;This won't apply to the benefits 
		folks get through Social Security, Medicaid, or Medicare.&nbsp;And it won't 
		apply to our national security -- including benefits for veterans.&nbsp;But 
		it will apply to all other discretionary government programs.&nbsp;And we're 
		not simply photocopying last year's budget; freezing spending does not 
		mean we won't cut what doesn't work to pay for what does.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have gone through every 
		department's spending line by line, item by item, looking for 
		inefficiency, duplication, and programs that have outlived their 
		usefulness.&nbsp;That's how we freeze discretionary spending. Last year, we 
		found $17 billion in cuts.&nbsp;This year, we've already found $20 billion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, some of these cuts are 
		just common sense.&nbsp;For example, we cut $115 million from a program that 
		pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up.&nbsp;We're 
		also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed 
		so far from any mission that it funded a music festival.&nbsp;And we're 
		saving $20 million by stopping the refurbishment of a Department of 
		Energy science center that the Department of Energy does not want to 
		refurbish.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other cuts, though, are more 
		painful, because the goals of the underlying programs are worthy.&nbsp; We 
		eliminate one program that provides grants to do environmental clean up 
		of abandoned buildings.&nbsp;That's a mission I support, but there are other 
		sources of private and public funds to achieve it.&nbsp;We also eliminated a 
		$120 million program that allows folks to get their Earned Income Tax 
		Credit in advance.&nbsp;I am a big supporter of the Earned Income Tax 
		Credit.&nbsp;The problem is 80 percent of people who got this advance didn't 
		comply with one or more of the program's requirements.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I'm willing to reduce 
		waste in programs I care about, and I'm asking members of Congress to do 
		the same.&nbsp; I'm asking Republicans and Democrats alike to take a fresh 
		look at programs they've supported in the past to see what's working and 
		what's not, and trim back accordingly.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Like any business, we're also looking for ways to get more bang for our 
		buck, by promoting innovation and cutting red tape. For example, we 
		consolidate 38 separate education programs into 11.&nbsp;And last fall, we 
		launched the &quot;SAVE Awards&quot; to solicit ideas from federal employees about 
		how make government more efficient and more effective.&nbsp;I'm proud to say 
		that a number of these ideas -- like allowing Social Security 
		appointments to be made online -- made it into our budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to note even 
		though the Department of Defense is exempt from the budget freeze, it's 
		not exempt from budget common sense.&nbsp;It's not exempt from looking for 
		savings.&nbsp;We save money by eliminating unnecessary defense programs that 
		do nothing to keep us safe.&nbsp;One example is the $2.5 billion that we're 
		spending to build C-17 transport aircraft.&nbsp;Four years ago, the Defense 
		Department decided to cease production because it had acquired the 
		number requested -- 180.&nbsp;Yet every year since, Congress had provided 
		unrequested money for more C-17s that the Pentagon doesn't want or 
		need.&nbsp;It's waste, pure and simple.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And there are other steps 
		we're taking to rein in deficits.&nbsp;I've proposed a fee on big banks to 
		pay back taxpayers for the bailout.&nbsp;We're reforming the way contracts 
		are awarded, to save taxpayers billions of dollars.&nbsp;And while we extend 
		middle-class tax cuts in this budget, we will not continue costly tax 
		cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers, and those making over 
		$250,000 a year.&nbsp;We just can't afford it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, changing 
		spending-as-usual depends on changing politics-as-usual.&nbsp;And that's why 
		I've proposed a bipartisan fiscal commission:&nbsp;a panel of Democrats and 
		Republicans who would hammer out concrete deficit reduction proposals 
		over the medium and long term, but would come up with those answers by a 
		certain deadline.&nbsp;I should point out, by the way, that is an idea that 
		had strong bipartisan support, was originally introduced by Senators 
		Gregg on the Republican side and Conrad on the Democratic side; had a 
		lot of Republican cosponsors to the idea.&nbsp;I hope that, despite the fact 
		that it got voted down in the Senate, that both the Republican Leader 
		Mitch McConnell and the Republican Leader in the House John Boehner go 
		ahead and fully embrace what has been a bipartisan idea to get our arms 
		around this budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's also why we're 
		restoring pay-as-you-go:&nbsp;a simple rule that says Congress can't spend a 
		dime without cutting a dime elsewhere.&nbsp;This rule helped lead to the 
		budget surpluses of the 1990s, and it's one of the most important steps 
		we can take to restore fiscal discipline in Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can read more about the 
		budget at <a href="http://www.budget.gov"><font color="#0000FF">
		budget.gov</font></a> -- very easy to remember --
		<a href="http://www.budget.gov"><font color="#0000FF">budget.gov</font></a>.&nbsp;But 
		the bottom line is this:&nbsp;We simply cannot continue to spend as if 
		deficits don't have consequences; as if waste doesn't matter; as if the 
		hard-earned tax dollars of the American people can be treated like 
		Monopoly money; as if we can ignore this challenge for another 
		generation.&nbsp;We can't.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to meet this 
		challenge, I welcome any idea, from Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;What I 
		will not welcome -- what I reject -- is the same old grandstanding when 
		the cameras are on, and the same irresponsible budget policies when the 
		cameras are off.&nbsp;It's time to hold Washington to the same standards 
		families and businesses hold themselves.&nbsp;It's time to save what we can, 
		spend what we must, and live within our means once again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks very much.</font></p>
