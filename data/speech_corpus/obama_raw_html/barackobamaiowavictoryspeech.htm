transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Iowa.<br>
<br>
You know, they said -- they said -- they said this day would never come.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They said our sights were set too high.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They said this country was too divided, 
too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done 
what the cynics said we couldn't do.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You have done what the state of New Hampshire can do in five days.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You have done 
what America can do in this new year, 2008.<br>
<br>
In lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big 
cities, you came together as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, to stand 
up and say that we are one nation. We are one people. And our time for change 
has come.<br>
<br>
You said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger 
that's consumed Washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and instead make 
it about addition; to build a coalition for change that stretches through red 
states and blue states; because that's how we'll win in November, and that's how we'll finally meet the 
challenges that we face as a nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are choosing hope over fear.
We're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerful message that change 
is coming to America.<br>
<br>
You said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their 
influence speak louder than our voices that they don't own this government -- we 
do. And we are here to take it back.<br>
<br>
The time has come for a President who will be honest about the choices and the 
challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we 
disagree, who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to 
know.<br>
<br>
And in New Hampshire, if you give me the same chance that Iowa did tonight, I 
will be that President for America.<br>
<br>
I'll be a President who finally makes health care affordable and available to 
every single American, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by -- by bringing Democrats and Republicans together to get the job done.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll be 
a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas 
and put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working Americans who deserve 
it.<br>
<br>
I'll be a President who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and 
entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.<br>
<br>
And I'll be a <a href="../wariniraq/barackobamairaqendofcombatops.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">President who ends this war in Iraq</font></a> and finally 
brings our troops home, who restores our moral standing, who understands that 
9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but a challenge that should unite America 
and the world against the common threats of the 21st century -- common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, 
genocide and disease.<br>
<br>
Tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of America because of what you 
did here in Iowa.
And so I'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, 
the volunteers and the staff who made this all possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And while I'm at it on thank you's, I think it 
makes sense for me to thank the love of my life, the rock of the Obama family, 
the closer on the campaign trail:
Give it up for Michelle Obama.<br>
<br>
I know you didn't do this for me. You did this -- You did this because you 
believed so deeply in the most American of ideas -- that in the face of 
impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.<br>
<br>
I know this. I know this because while I may be standing here tonight, I'll 
never forget that my journey began on the streets of Chicago doing what so many 
of you have done for this campaign and all the campaigns here in Iowa: 
organizing and working and fighting to make people's lives just a little bit 
better.<br>
<br>
I know how hard it is. It comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of 
sacrifice. There are days of disappointment. But sometimes, just sometimes, 
there are nights like this: a night -- a night that, years from now, when we've made the 
changes we believe in, when more families can afford to see a doctor, when our 
children -- when Malia and Sasha and your children inherit a planet that's a 
little cleaner and safer, when the world sees America differently, and America 
sees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look 
back with pride and say that this was the moment when it all began.<br>
<br>
This was the moment when the improbable beat what Washington always said was 
inevitable.<br>
<br>
This was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too 
long; when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we 
finally gave Americans who had never participated in politics a reason to stand 
up and to do so.<br>
<br>
This was the moment when we finally beat back the poli[tics] of fear and doubt 
and cynicism, the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this 
country up. This was the moment.<br>
<br>
Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this 
was the place where America remembered what it means to hope. For many months, 
we've been teased, even derided for talking about hope. But we always knew that 
hope is not blind optimism. It's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or 
the roadblocks that stand in our path.<br>
<br>
It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing 
inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something 
better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and 
to fight for it.<br>
<br>
Hope is what I saw in the eyes of the young woman in Cedar Rapids who works the 
night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a 
sister who's ill -- a young woman who still believes that this country will give 
her the chance to live out her dreams.<br>
<br>
Hope is what I heard in the voice of the New Hampshire woman who told me that 
she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for Iraq -- who still goes 
to bed each night praying for his safe return.<br>
<br>
Hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the 
greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young 
women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march 
through Selma and Montgomery for freedom's cause.<br>
<br>
Hope -- Hope is what led me here today. With a father from Kenya, a mother from 
Kansas, and a story that could only happen in the United States of America.<br>
<br>
Hope is the bedrock of this nation -- the belief that our destiny will not be 
written for us, but by us, by all those men and women who are not content to 
settle for the world as it is, who have the courage to remake the world as it 
should be.<br>
<br>
That is what we started here in Iowa and that is the message we can now carry to 
New Hampshire and beyond; the same message we had when we were up and when we were down; the one that can 
save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand by calloused 
hand; that together, 
ordinary people can do extraordinary things.<br>
<br>
Because we are not a collection of red states and blue states. We are the United 
States of America. And in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe 
again.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Iowa.</font></p>
