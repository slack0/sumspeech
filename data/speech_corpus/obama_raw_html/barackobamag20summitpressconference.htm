		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good afternoon, or good 
		evening -- we're running a little bit late.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earlier today, we 
		finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning 
		point in our pursuit of global economic recovery. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By any measure, the London 
		summit was historic.&nbsp; It was historic because of the size and the scope 
		of the challenges that we face, and because of the timeliness and 
		magnitude of our response. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The challenge is clear.&nbsp; The 
		global economy is contracting. Trade is shrinking.&nbsp; Unemployment is 
		rising.&nbsp; The international finance system is nearly frozen.&nbsp; Even these 
		facts can't fully capture the crisis that we're confronting, because 
		behind them is the pain and uncertainty that so many people are facing.&nbsp; 
		We see it back in the United States.&nbsp; We see it here in London.&nbsp; We see 
		it around the world:&nbsp; families losing their homes, workers losing their 
		jobs and their savings, students who are deferring their dreams.&nbsp; So 
		many have lost so much.&nbsp; Just to underscore this point, back in the 
		United States, jobless claims released today were the highest in 26 
		years.&nbsp; We owe it to all of our citizens to act, and to act with a sense 
		of urgency.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In an age where our 
		economies are linked more closely than ever before, the whole world has 
		been touched by this devastating downturn.&nbsp; And today, the world's 
		leaders have responded with an unprecedented set of comprehensive and 
		coordinated actions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, just keep in mind some 
		historical context.&nbsp; Faced with similar global challenges in the past, 
		the world was slow to act, and people paid an enormous price.&nbsp; That was 
		true in the Great Depression, when nations prolonged and worsened the 
		crisis by turning inward, waiting for more than a decade to meet the 
		challenge together.&nbsp; Even as recently as the 1980s, the slow global 
		response deepened and widened a debt crisis in Latin America that pushed 
		millions into poverty. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we've learned the 
		lessons of history.&nbsp; I know that in the days leading up to the summit, 
		some of you in the press, some commentators, confused honest and open 
		debate with irreconcilable differences.&nbsp; But after weeks of preparation, 
		and two days of careful negotiation, we have agreed on a series of 
		unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this 
		from happening again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me outline what I think 
		has been most significant.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number one, we are committed 
		to growth and job creation.&nbsp; All G20 nations have acted to stimulate 
		demand, which will total well over $2 trillion in global fiscal 
		expansion.&nbsp; The United States is also partnering with the private sector 
		to clean out the troubled assets, the legacy assets that are crippling 
		some banks, and using the full force of the government to ensure that 
		our action leads directly to loans to businesses large and small, as 
		well as individuals who depend on credit.&nbsp; And these efforts will be 
		amplified by our G20 partners, who are pursuing similarly comprehensive 
		programs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we also agreed on bold 
		action to support developing countries, so that we aren't faced with 
		declining markets that the global economy depends on.&nbsp; Together, the G20 
		is tripling the IMF's lending capacity and promoting lending by 
		multilateral development banks to increase the purchasing power and 
		expand markets in every country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've also rejected the 
		protectionism that could deepen this crisis.&nbsp; History tells us that 
		turning inward can help turn a downturn into a depression.&nbsp; And this 
		cooperation between the world's leading economies signals our support 
		for open markets, as does our multilateral commitment to trade finance 
		that will grow our exports and create new jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's all on the growth 
		front.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And next we made enormous 
		strides in committing ourselves to comprehensive reform of a failed 
		regulatory system.&nbsp; And together, I believe that we must put an end to 
		the bubble-and-bust economy that has stood in the way of sustained 
		growth and enabled abusive risk-taking that endangers our prosperity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At home, back in the States, 
		our efforts began with the approach that Secretary Geithner proposed 
		last week, the strongest regulatory reforms any nation has contemplated 
		so far to prevent the massive failure of responsibility that we have 
		already seen.&nbsp; Today, these principles have informed and enabled the 
		coordinated action that we will take with our G20 partners. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To prevent future crises, we 
		agreed to increased transparency and capital protections for financial 
		institutions. We're extending supervision to all systemically important 
		institutions, markets and products, including hedge funds.&nbsp; We'll 
		identify jurisdictions that fail to cooperate, including tax havens, and 
		take action to defend our financial system.&nbsp; We will reestablish the 
		Financial Stability Forum with a stronger mandate.&nbsp; And we will reform 
		and expand the IMF and World Bank so they are more efficient, effective 
		and representative.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we are protecting 
		those who don't always have a voice at the G20, but who have suffered 
		greatly in this crisis.&nbsp; And the United States is ready to lead in this 
		endeavor.&nbsp; In the coming days, I intend to work with Congress to provide 
		$448 million in immediate assistance to vulnerable populations -- from 
		Africa to Latin America -- and to double support for food safety to over 
		$1 billion so that we are giving people the tools they need to lift 
		themselves out of poverty.&nbsp; We will also support the United Nations and 
		World Bank as they coordinate the rapid assistance necessary to prevent 
		humanitarian catastrophe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have to say, though, that 
		this is not just charity.&nbsp; These are all future markets for all 
		countries, and future drivers of world economic growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me also underscore my 
		appreciation to Prime Minister Brown, his entire team, and all my 
		colleagues from around the world who contributed to the summit's 
		success.&nbsp; You know, it's hard for 20 heads of state to bridge their 
		differences.&nbsp; We've all got our own national policies; we all have our 
		own assumptions, our own political cultures.&nbsp; But our citizens are all 
		hurting.&nbsp; They all need us to come together.&nbsp; So I'm pleased that the 
		G20 has agreed to meet again this fall, because I believe that this is 
		just the beginning.&nbsp; Our problems are not going to be solved in one 
		meeting; they're not going to be solved in two meetings.&nbsp; We're going to 
		have to be proactive in shaping events and persistent in monitoring our 
		progress to determine whether further action is needed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to just make a 
		few remarks about additional meetings I had outside of the G20 context.&nbsp; 
		While here in London I had the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings 
		with leaders of Russia, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and India, as 
		well as Great Britain.&nbsp; And these discussions were extraordinarily 
		valuable and productive.&nbsp; Of course, we spoke about additional steps to 
		promote economic recovery and growth.&nbsp; But we also discussed coordinated 
		actions on a range of issues:&nbsp; how we could reduce the nuclear threat; 
		how we could forge a coordinated response to North Korea's planned 
		missile launch; how we can turn back terrorism and stabilize 
		Afghanistan; how we can protect our planet from the scourge of climate 
		change.&nbsp; I'm encouraged that we laid the groundwork for real and lasting 
		progress on a host of these issues. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ultimately, the challenges 
		of the 21st century can't be met without collective action.&nbsp; Agreement 
		will almost never be easy, and results won't always come quickly.&nbsp; But I 
		am committed to respecting different points of view, and to forging a 
		consensus instead of dictating our terms.&nbsp; That's how we made progress 
		in the last few days.&nbsp; And that's how we will advance and uphold our 
		ideals in the months and years to come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, at home, I've 
		often spoken about a new era of responsibility.&nbsp; And I believe strongly 
		that this era must not end at our borders.&nbsp; In a world that's more and 
		more interconnected, we all have responsibilities to work together to 
		solve common challenges.&nbsp; And although it will take time, I am confident 
		that we will rebuild global prosperity if we act with a common sense of 
		purpose, persistence, and the optimism that the moment demands.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I appreciate your 
		attention, and I'm going to take a few questions.&nbsp; I've got a list of a 
		few people I'm going to call on and then I will intersperse some folks 
		I'm calling on randomly.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Helene Cooper.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, -- 
		[inaudible] </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, 
		I think we did okay.&nbsp; You know, when I came here, it was with the 
		intention of listening and learning, but also providing American 
		leadership.&nbsp; And I think that the document that has been produced as 
		well as the concrete actions that will follow reflect a range of our 
		priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We wanted to make sure that 
		we had a strong, coordinated response to growth -- and that's reflected 
		in the document and in the actions that will be taken.&nbsp; We thought it 
		was important to make sure that we had a strong, coordinated regulatory 
		response&nbsp; -- and many of the details of the regulatory response draw 
		from principles that we had developed prior to coming here.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We felt that it was very 
		important to strengthen our international financial institutions because 
		developing countries, emerging markets are threatened -- even though 
		they may not have been the cause of this crisis -- they are threatened 
		by capital flight; they're threatened by reduced trade finance; drops in 
		consumer demand in developed countries that were their export markets, 
		and so we knew that it was going to be important to provide those 
		countries with assistance.&nbsp; And we have created as fundamental a 
		reworking of the resources available to these international financial 
		institutions as anything we've done in the last several decades.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, overall, I'm pleased 
		with the product.&nbsp; And I'll leave it to others to determine whether me 
		and my team had anything to do with that.&nbsp; All right?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chuck Todd.&nbsp; Chuck.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What concrete items 
		that you got out of this G20 can you tell the American people back home 
		who are hurting, the family struggling, seeing their retirement go down, 
		or worrying about losing their job -- what happened here today that 
		helps that family back home in the heartland?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, as I 
		said before, we've got a global economy, and if we're taking actions in 
		isolation in the United States, but those actions are contradicted 
		overseas, then we're only going to be halfway effective -- maybe not 
		even half.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You've seen, for example, a 
		drastic decline in U.S. exports over the last several months.&nbsp; You look 
		at a company like Caterpillar, in my home state of Illinois, which up 
		until last year was doing extraordinarily well; in fact, export growth 
		was what had sustained it even after the recession had begun.&nbsp; As a 
		consequence of the world recession, as a consequence of the contagion 
		from the financial markets debilitating the economies elsewhere, 
		Caterpillar is now in very bad shape.&nbsp; So if we want to get Caterpillar 
		back on its feet, if we want to get all those export companies back on 
		their feet, so that they are hiring, putting people back to work, 
		putting money in people's pockets, we've got to make sure that the 
		global economy as a whole is successful.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this document, which 
		affirms the need for all countries to take fiscal responses that 
		increase demand, that encourages the openness of markets, those are all 
		going to be helpful in us being able to fix what ails the economy back 
		home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me mix in a -- Justin 
		Webb, BBC.&nbsp; Where's Justin?&nbsp; There he is.&nbsp; Go ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, in the 
		spirit of openness, with which you say you're -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Why don't 
		you get a microphone?&nbsp; See, everybody is complaining.&nbsp; I'm 
		sure that's all your fellow British journalists.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're extraordinarily 
		well behaved, Mr. President.&nbsp; In the spirit of openness, 
		with which you say you're going to run your administration, could you 
		give us an insight into an area or areas where you came to London 
		wanting something and you didn't get it; where you compromised, where 
		you gave something away to achieve the wider breakthrough agreement?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, I 
		think that if you look at the language of the document, there are 
		probably some areas where it wasn't so much of a sacrifice as it might 
		not have been our number-one priority, but it became clear that it was 
		very important to certain other actors. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'd rather not specify what 
		those precise items would be, because this is a collective document.&nbsp; 
		But there's no doubt that each country has its own quirks and own 
		particular issues that a leader may decide is really, really important; 
		something that is non-negotiable for them.&nbsp; And what we tried to do as 
		much as possible was to accommodate those issues in a way that didn't -- 
		did not hamper the effectiveness of the overall document to address what 
		I think are the core issues related to this crisis.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, keep in mind -- I think 
		that this kind of coordination really is historic.&nbsp; I said in the 
		meeting that if you had imagined 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, or 30 
		years ago, that you'd have the leaders of Germany, France, China, 
		Russia, Brazil, South Africa, a President of the United States named 
		Obama -- former adversaries, in some cases former mortal 
		enemies, negotiating this swiftly on behalf of fixing the global 
		economy, you would have said, that's crazy.&nbsp; And yet it was happening, 
		and it happened with relatively little -- relatively few hiccups.&nbsp; And I 
		think that's a testimony to the great work that Gordon Brown did, and 
		his team, in organizing the summit, the collective work in our teams in 
		doing some good preparation, some good ground work.&nbsp; So I'm very proud 
		of what's been done.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This alone is not enough.&nbsp; 
		And obviously the actions that each of us take in our individual 
		countries are still absolutely vital.&nbsp; So we have a set of principles, 
		for example, around dealing with systemic risk that I think will be very 
		important in preventing the kinds of financial crises that we've seen.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That does not entirely solve 
		the problem of toxic assets that are still in U.S. banks and certain 
		British banks and certain European banks.&nbsp; And how each individual 
		nation acts to deal with that is still going to be vitally important.&nbsp; 
		How well we execute the respective stimulus programs around the world is 
		going to be very important.&nbsp; The quicker they are, the more effective 
		they are at actually boosting demand, the more all of us will benefit.&nbsp; 
		The more encumbered they are by bureaucracy and mismanagement and 
		corruption, that will hamper our development efforts as a whole.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is not a 
		panacea, but it is a critical step, and I think it lays the foundation 
		so that, should the actions that we've taken individually and 
		collectively so far not succeed in boosting global demand and growth, 
		should you continue to see a freezing of credit or a hemorrhaging of 
		jobs around the world, I think we've created a good foundation for this 
		leadership to come back together again and take additional steps until 
		we get it right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Okay, Michael Shear.&nbsp; 
		Where's Michael?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. 
		President.&nbsp; I wonder if you view this trip that you're on and the 
		actions that you've taken here at the G20 and with the bilateral 
		meetings that you've had as representing a break from the foreign policy 
		of your predecessor. And if so, could you describe where you see and how 
		you see the principles that guide a different view of the world?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, 
		you know, I didn't accompany President Bush on his various summits, so I 
		don't know how he was operating.&nbsp; And I won't -- I won't warrant a guess 
		on that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can tell you that 
		what I've tried to do since I started running for President and since I 
		was sworn in as President, is to communicate the notion that America is 
		a critical actor and leader on the world stage, and that we shouldn't be 
		embarrassed about that, but that we exercise our leadership best when we 
		are listening; when we recognize that the world is a complicated place 
		and that we are going to have to act in partnership with other 
		countries; when we lead by example; when we show some element of 
		humility and recognize that we may not always have the best answer, but 
		we can always encourage the best answer and support the best answer.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I think that's the 
		-- that's the approach that we've tried to take in our foreign policy 
		since my administration came in.&nbsp; Now, we come in at extraordinarily 
		challenging times, and yet I actually think that that calls for this 
		type of leadership even more.&nbsp; But, ultimately, we won't know how 
		effective we are until we look back a year from now, or two years from 
		now, or three years from now and see if it worked.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what the American people 
		care about I suspect are the same thing that the British people care 
		about, and that is, are you putting people back to work?&nbsp; Are businesses 
		growing again?&nbsp; Is business -- is credit flowing again?&nbsp; And, you know 
		-- and that's just true with respect to this summit.&nbsp; But when it comes 
		to our Afghanistan policy, the question is going to be, have we made 
		ourselves safer; have we reduced the risks and incidents of terrorism?
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so the proof of the 
		pudding is in the eating.&nbsp; But hopefully, I think at least we've set a 
		tone internationally where people don't -- where they give us the 
		benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; They're still going to have their interests, and 
		we're going to have ours.&nbsp; There are going to be tough negotiations, and 
		sometimes we're going to have to walk away from those negotiations if we 
		can't arrive at a common accord.&nbsp; There are going to be real dangers 
		that can't always be talked through and have to be addressed.&nbsp; But at 
		least we can start with the notion that we're prepared to listen and to 
		work cooperatively with countries around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All right, let me 
		sprinkle in another -- it's got to be an international person.&nbsp; All 
		right, this young lady right there.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. President, 
		Emma Alberici from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.&nbsp; At the 
		moment, in the U.S., the U.K., and in Australia, executive salaries and 
		bonuses are decided in the boardrooms of major publicly listed 
		companies.&nbsp; Who will be making those decisions on salaries and bonuses 
		as a result of the agreement you've made here today?&nbsp; And if it is still 
		the boards, will they be guided by principles or legislation?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; The 
		principles that we outlined I think put in place or move us in the 
		direction of what I consider to be best practices, which is that there 
		is some accountability with respect to executive compensation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, theoretically, 
		that should be the shareholders.&nbsp; But the way that too many corporations 
		have operated for too long is that you have a CEO who basically selects 
		his board; the board, in a fairly cozy relationship oftentimes with the 
		executive, hires a executive compensation firm, which, surprisingly, 
		tends to think that it's necessary to retain the best talent to pay 
		people $20 or $30 million a year; and we get into the kinds of habits 
		and practices that I think have not been -- have not served shareholders 
		well, I think ultimately distort the decision-making of many CEOs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I was in the 
		United States Senate, I actually worked on a piece of legislation that 
		would -- made the simple proposition that executive compensation should 
		be subject to a shareholder vote, even if it was nonbinding, so that 
		there was transparency and accountability and perhaps a shame function 
		that would take place.&nbsp; And that principle, I think, is reflected in 
		these guidelines.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What it says is, is 
		that if you get shareholders involved and those shareholders are given a 
		set of principles and best practices by which they can judge executive 
		compensation, then you can still have outsized rewards and success for 
		successful business people, but it will be based on not short-term 
		performance, not three-month performance, not your ability to flip quick 
		profits off products like derivatives that don't turn out to be 
		particularly productive to the company, but based on sustained, 
		effective growth.&nbsp; And that's what's embodied in these documents, and I 
		think that you're going to see a lot of countries try to encourage that 
		kind of transparency and accountability. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It doesn't mean the 
		state micromanaging -- [sneezes] -- excuse me -- I've been fighting 
		this all week -- it doesn't mean that we want the state dictating 
		salaries; we don't.&nbsp; We -- I strongly believe in a free-market system, 
		and as I -- as I think people understand in America, at least, people 
		don't resent the rich; they want to be rich.&nbsp; And that's good.&nbsp; But we 
		want to make sure that there's mechanisms in place that holds people 
		accountable and produces results.&nbsp; Okay?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Got to go back to my 
		crew.&nbsp; Jake Tapper.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. 
		President.&nbsp; Two questions.&nbsp; One, can you say with confidence that the 
		steps the G20 nations are taking today -- committing to today will help 
		the world, or will prevent the world to avoid a depression or a deeper 
		recession?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And two, your friend 
		and ally, Prime Minister Brown, said that &quot;The old Washington consensus 
		is over; today we have reached a new consensus.&quot;&nbsp; Is he right?&nbsp; And what 
		do you think he meant by that?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; In 
		life there are no guarantees; in economics there are no guarantees.&nbsp; The 
		people who thought they could provide guarantees, many of them worked at 
		AIG and it didn't work out so well.&nbsp; So there are always risks 
		involved.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have no doubt, 
		though, that the steps that have been taken are critical to preventing 
		us sliding into a depression.&nbsp; They are bolder and more rapid than any 
		international response that we've seen to a financial crisis in memory.&nbsp; 
		And I think that they will have a concrete effect in our ability, 
		individually, in each nation, to create jobs, save jobs that exist, grow 
		the economy, loosen up credit, restore trust and confidence in the 
		financial markets.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So these steps -- 
		another way of putting it is I think the steps in the communiqué were 
		necessary.&nbsp; Whether they're sufficient, we've got to -- we've got to 
		wait and see.&nbsp; I'm actually confident, though, that given the common 
		commitment in the United States and in the other G20 countries to act 
		rapidly and boldly, that if we see other inklings of panic in the 
		marketplace, or things unwinding, that this group, once again, will 
		respond as needed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I guess maybe just 
		to use an analogy that was used several times in this meeting, an 
		analogy that I've used in the past:&nbsp; You got a sick patient; I think we 
		applied the right medicine; I think the patient is stabilized; there's 
		still wounds that have to heal and there's still emergencies that could 
		arise, but I think that you've got some pretty good care being applied.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You had a second, 
		follow-up question?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister 
		Brown saying -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Oh, 
		the Washington consensus.&nbsp; Well, the Washington consensus, as I'm sure 
		you're aware, Jake, is sort of a term of art about a certain set of 
		policies surrounding globalization and the application of a 
		cookie-cutter model to economic growth, trade liberalization, 
		deregulation that was popular and did help globalize and grow the 
		economy, and was led by some of our leading economists and policymakers 
		in Washington.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think that there's 
		always been a spectrum of opinion about how unfettered the free market 
		is.&nbsp; And along that spectrum, I think there have been some who believe 
		in very fierce regulation and are very suspicious of globalization, and 
		there are others who think that it's always -- that the market is always 
		king.&nbsp; And I think what we've learned here, but if anybody had been 
		studying history they would have understood earlier, is that the market 
		is the most effective mechanism for creating wealth and distributing 
		resources to produce goods and services that history has ever known, but 
		that it goes off the rail sometimes; that if it's completely 
		unregulated, that if there are no thoughtful frameworks to channel the 
		creative energy of the market, that it can end up in a very bad place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, in that sense, 
		I think that we just went through a couple of decades where there was an 
		artificial complacency about the dangers of markets going off the 
		rails.&nbsp; And a crisis like this reminds us that we just have to put in 
		some common-sense rules of the road, without throwing out the enormous 
		benefits that globalization have brought in terms of improving living 
		standards, reducing the cost of goods, and bringing the world closer 
		together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All right, I've got 
		time for just a couple more questions.&nbsp; I'm going to find a journalist 
		here --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- [inaudible]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about me?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; All 
		right, I'm going to call on this gentleman right here.&nbsp; He's been very 
		persistent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; China 
		Central Television.&nbsp; Since the world leaders have been talking about 
		increasing the voice and voting rights of developing countries, I would 
		like to ask two questions instead of just one.&nbsp; First of all, on behalf 
		of China --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I may 
		choose which one I want to answer.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; 
		That's always the danger of asking two questions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, 
		you've had a very fruitful meeting with our President.&nbsp; And during the 
		Clinton administration, U.S.-China relationship were characterized, in 
		Clinton's words, &quot;strategic, constructive partnership.&quot;&nbsp; During the Bush 
		era, it was -- the catchphrase was &quot;stakeholder.&quot;&nbsp; The Bush 
		administration expects China to become a responsible stakeholder in 
		international affairs.&nbsp; Have you come up with a catchphrase of your 
		own?&nbsp; And certainly it is not the G2, is it?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My second question is, 
		on behalf of the world, politics is very local, even though we've been 
		talking about global solution, as indicated by your recent preference 
		over American journalists and British -- which is okay.&nbsp; How can you make sure that you will do whatever you can so that -- that 
		local politics will not trump or negatively affect good international 
		economics? Thank you, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, 
		those are excellent questions.&nbsp; On the first question, your American 
		counterparts will tell you I'm terrible with those little catchphrases 
		and sound bites.&nbsp; So I haven't come up with anything catchy yet, but if 
		you have any suggestions, let me know.&nbsp; I'll be happy to 
		use them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In terms of local 
		politics, look, I'm the President of the United States.&nbsp; I'm not the 
		President of China, I'm not the President of Japan, I'm not the 
		President of the other participants here.&nbsp; And so I have a direct 
		responsibility to my constituents to make their lives better.&nbsp; That's 
		why they put me in there.&nbsp; That accounts for some of the questions here, 
		about how concretely does me being here help them find a job, pay for 
		their home, send their kids to college, live what we call the American 
		Dream.&nbsp; And I will be judged by my effectiveness in meeting their needs 
		and concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But in an era of integration 
		and interdependence, it is also my responsibility to lead America into 
		recognizing that its interests, its fate is tied up with the larger 
		world; that if we neglect or abandon those who are suffering in poverty, 
		that not only are we depriving ourselves of potential opportunities for 
		markets and economic growth, but ultimately that despair may turn to 
		violence that turns on us; that unless we are concerned about the 
		education of all children and not just our children, not only may we be 
		depriving ourselves of the next great scientist who's going to find the 
		next new energy source that saves the planet, but we also may make 
		people around the world much more vulnerable to anti-American 
		propaganda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So if I'm effective as 
		America's President right now, part of that effectiveness involves 
		holding a -- providing Americans insight into how their self-interest is 
		tied up with yours.&nbsp; And that's an ongoing project because it's not 
		always obvious.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And there are going to be 
		times where short-term interests are going to differ; there's no doubt 
		about it.&nbsp; And protectionism is the classic example.&nbsp; You can make 
		arguments that if you can get away with protecting your markets, as long 
		as the other folks don't protect theirs, then in the short term you may 
		benefit.&nbsp; And it then becomes important not only for me to try to give 
		people a sense of why, over the long term, that's counterproductive, but 
		also it becomes important for me to put policies in place in the United 
		States that provide a cushion, provide support for those people who may 
		suffer local dislocations because of globalization.&nbsp; And that's 
		something that I think every government has to think about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are individuals who 
		will be harmed by a trade deal.&nbsp; There are businesses who will go out of 
		business because of free trade.&nbsp; And to the extent that a government is 
		not there to help them reshape their company or retrain for the new jobs 
		that are being created, over time you're going to get people who see -- 
		who rightly see their personal self-interest in very narrow terms.&nbsp; 
		Okay?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two more questions.&nbsp; 
		Jonathan Weisman. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. 
		President.&nbsp; During the campaign you often spoke of a diminished power 
		and authority of the United States over the last decade.&nbsp; This is your 
		first time in an international summit like this, and I'm wondering what 
		evidence you saw of what you spoke of during the campaign.&nbsp; And 
		specifically, is the declaration of the end of the Washington consensus 
		evidence of the diminished authority that you feared was out there?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, 
		first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss 
		of authority was inevitable.&nbsp; I said it was traced to very specific 
		decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had 
		lowered our standing in the world.&nbsp; And that wasn't simply my opinion; 
		that was, it turns out, the opinion of many people around the world.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I would like to think that 
		with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're 
		starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.&nbsp; 
		And although, as you know, I always mistrust polls, international polls 
		seem to indicate that you're seeing people more hopeful about America's 
		leadership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we remain the largest 
		economy in the world by a pretty significant margin.&nbsp; We remain the most 
		powerful military on Earth.&nbsp; Our production of culture, our politics, 
		our media still have -- I didn't mean to say that with such scorn, guys 
		-- you know I'm teasing -- still has enormous influence.&nbsp; 
		And so I do not buy into the notion that America can't lead in the 
		world.&nbsp; I wouldn't be here if I didn't think that we had important 
		things to contribute.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I just think in a world 
		that is as complex as it is, that it is very important for us to be able 
		to forge partnerships as opposed to simply dictating solutions.&nbsp; Just a 
		-- just to try to crystallize the example, there's been a lot of 
		comparison here about Bretton Woods.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, well, last time you saw the 
		entire international architecture being remade.&quot;&nbsp; Well, if there's just 
		Roosevelt and Churchill sitting in a room with a brandy, that's a -- 
		that's an easier negotiation.&nbsp; But that's not the world we 
		live in, and it shouldn't be the world that we live in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so that's not a 
		loss for America; it's an appreciation that Europe is now rebuilt and a 
		powerhouse.&nbsp; Japan is rebuilt, is a powerhouse.&nbsp; China, India -- these 
		are all countries on the move.&nbsp; And that's good.&nbsp; That means there are 
		millions of people -- billions of people -- who are working their way 
		out of poverty.&nbsp; And over time, that potentially makes this a much more 
		peaceful world.&nbsp; <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And that's the kind of leadership we need to show -- one that helps 
		guide that process of orderly integration without taking our eyes off 
		the fact that it's only as good as the benefits of individual families, 
		individual children:&nbsp; Is it giving them more opportunity; is it giving 
		them a better life?&nbsp; If we judge ourselves by those standards, then I 
		think America can continue to show leadership for a very long time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm going to call one 
		foreigner -- actually, I'm the foreigner.&nbsp; That's why I 
		smiled.&nbsp; One correspondent not from America.&nbsp; And then I will -- 
		[vociferous 
		commotion] -- we're not doing bidding here.&nbsp; But I also 
		want to make sure that I'm not showing gender bias.&nbsp; So this young lady 
		right here -- not you, sir, I'm sorry.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, Mr. President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; How 
		are you?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for 
		choosing me.&nbsp; I'm very well.&nbsp; I'm from the Times of India.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; 
		Wonderful.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You met with our 
		Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.&nbsp; What did you -- what is America doing 
		to help India tackle terrorism emanating from Pakistan?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, 
		first of all, your Prime Minister is a wonderful man.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I 
		agree.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well --
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Did 
		you have something to do with that, or -- You seem to kind of take -- 
		take credit for it a little bit there. <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really proud of him, sir.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Of 
		course.&nbsp; You should be proud of him.&nbsp; I'm teasing you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think he's a very 
		wise and decent man, and has done a wonderful job in guiding India, even 
		prior to being Prime Minister, along a path of extraordinary economic 
		growth that is a marvel, I think, for all the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We did discuss the 
		issue of terrorism.&nbsp; And we discussed it not simply in terms of 
		terrorism emanating from Pakistan, although obviously we are very 
		concerned about extremists and terrorists who have made camp in the 
		border regions of Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan.&nbsp; But we spoke 
		about it more broadly in terms of how we can coordinate effectively on 
		issues of counterterrorism.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also spoke about the fact 
		that in a nuclear age, at a time when perhaps the greatest enemy of both 
		India and Pakistan should be poverty, that it may make sense to create a 
		more effective dialogue between India and Pakistan.&nbsp; But obviously we 
		didn't go in depth into those issues.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We talked about a whole 
		range of other issues related to, for example, energy, and how important 
		it is for the United States to lead by example in reducing our carbon 
		footprint so that we can help to forge agreements with countries like 
		China and India that, on a per-capita basis, have a much smaller 
		footprint and so justifiably chafe at the idea that they should have to 
		sacrifice their development for our efforts to control climate change; 
		but also acknowledging that if China and India, with their populations, 
		had the same energy usage as the average American, then we would have 
		all melted by now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so that was a very 
		interesting conversation that I will be pursuing not just with India, 
		but hopefully with China and with other countries around the world.&nbsp; In 
		some ways our European counterparts have moved more quickly than we have 
		on this issue. But I think even the Europeans have recognized that it's 
		not easy.&nbsp; It's even harder during times of economic downturn.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so we're going to have 
		to combine the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency with rapid 
		technological advances.&nbsp; And to the extent that in some cases we can get 
		international cooperation and pool our scientific and technical 
		knowledge around things like developing coal sequestration, for example, 
		that can be extremely helpful.&nbsp; Okay?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm going to call on my last 
		American correspondent, Chip.&nbsp; And, Chip, my heart goes out to you.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you 
		very much, Mr. President.&nbsp; I appreciate that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I just 
		heard about that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly there is a 
		lot of sentiment in G20 countries that the United States was a major 
		cause of the global economic meltdown.&nbsp; To what degree did that topic 
		come up in your discussions?&nbsp; Did it make it difficult for some 
		countries to accept advice from the United States when they blame the 
		United States and its economic system for causing this in the first 
		place?&nbsp; And how do you respond to people who do blame America?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, you 
		know, I don't think that -- I think my colleagues in the G20 were 
		extraordinarily gracious about my participation.&nbsp; I think that they 
		continue to express the desire to work with America, admiration about 
		many things American.&nbsp; There were occasional comments, usually wedged 
		into some other topic, that indicated from their perspective that this 
		started in America, or this started on Wall Street, or this started with 
		particular banks or companies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps what helped was 
		my willingness to acknowledge that&nbsp; -- and it's hard to deny -- that 
		some of this contagion did start on Wall Street.&nbsp; And as I've said back 
		home, as I've said in public and as I would say in private, we had a 
		number of firms that took wild and unjustified risks, we had regulators 
		that were asleep at the switch, and it has taken an enormous toll on the 
		U.S. economy and has spread to the world economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I think that part 
		of the reason people didn't give me too hard a time is because if you 
		look at European banks or Asian banks, that they've had their own issues 
		both in the past and in the future.&nbsp; And I think there was a very 
		constructive discussion about the fact that, given global financial 
		flows, that unless we've got much more effective coordinated regulatory 
		strategies, supervision, standards, that these problems will appear 
		again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Money is -- can move around 
		the globe in a second.&nbsp; And it will seek out the highest returns, and if 
		those highest returns end up being built on a house of cards, then we're 
		going to be seeing another threat to the world financial system wherever 
		that house of cards might be. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, overall, I think 
		there was an extraordinarily constructive approach among all the 
		leaders.&nbsp; I was very impressed with them.&nbsp; I'm very grateful to them.&nbsp; 
		And I'm excited about the ability not just to help heal this economy but 
		also to make progress on a sustainable model of economic growth that 
		relies less on a cycle of bubble and bust -- something that I've spoken 
		about back home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All right?&nbsp; Thank you, 
		everybody.&nbsp; Appreciate it.</font></p>
