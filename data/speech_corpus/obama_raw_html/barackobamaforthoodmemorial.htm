		a determination to honor them through the work we carry on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a time of war.&nbsp;Yet 
		these Americans did not die on a foreign field of battle.&nbsp;They were

		tragedy even more painful, even more incomprehensible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For those families who have 
		lost a loved one, no words can fill the void that's been left.&nbsp;We knew 
		these men and women as soldiers and caregivers.&nbsp;You knew them as mothers

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But here is what you must 
		also know:&nbsp;Your loved ones endure through the life of our nation.&nbsp; Their

		too often take for granted.&nbsp;Every evening that the sun sets on a 
		tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; every moment that an 
		American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is 
		their legacy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Neither this country, nor 
		the values upon which we were founded, could exist without men and 
		women like these 13 Americans. And that is why we must pay tribute to 
		their stories.</font></p>

		<font size="2" face="Verdana">These men and women came 
		from all parts of the country.&nbsp;Some had long careers in the military. 
		Some had signed up to serve in the shadow of 9/11.&nbsp;Some had known 
		intense combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, and some cared for those 
		did.&nbsp;Their lives speak to the strength, the dignity, the decency of 
		those who serve, and that's how they will be remembered.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For that same spirit is 
		embodied in the community here at Fort Hood, and in the many wounded who 
		are still recovering.&nbsp;As was already mentioned, in those terrible 
		minutes during the attack, soldiers made makeshift tourniquets out of 
		their clothes. They braved gunfire to reach the wounded, and ferried 
		them back to safety in the backs of cars and a pickup truck.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One young soldier, Amber 
		Bahr, was so intent on helping others, she did not realize for some time 
		that she, herself, had been shot in the back.&nbsp;Two police officers -- 
		Mark Todd and Kim Munley -- saved countless lives by risking their own.&nbsp;One medic -- Francisco de la Serna -- treated both Officer Munley and 
		the gunman who shot her.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It may be hard to comprehend 
		the twisted logic that led to this tragedy.&nbsp;But this much we do know: 
		No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts. No just and loving 
		God looks upon them with favor.&nbsp;For what he has done, we know that the 
		killer will be met with justice -- in this world, and the next.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are trying times for 
		our country.&nbsp;In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the same extremists who killed 
		nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America, our allies, and 
		innocent Afghans and Pakistanis. In Iraq, we're working to bring a war 
		to a successful end, as there are still those who would deny the Iraqi 
		people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we face these challenges, 
		the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that we are 
		fighting for, and the strength that we must draw upon.&nbsp;Theirs are the 
		tales of American men and women answering an extraordinary call -- the 
		call to serve their comrades, their communities, and their country.&nbsp;In 
		an age of self -- selfishness, they embody responsibility.&nbsp;In an era of 
		division, they call upon us to come together.&nbsp;In a time of cynicism, 
		they remind us of who we are as Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are a nation that endures 
		because of the courage of those who defend it.&nbsp;We saw that valor in 
		those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood, just as surely as we see it 
		in those who signed up knowing they would serve in harm’s way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are a nation of laws 
		whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman 
		and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for 
		his crimes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're a nation that 
		guarantees the freedom to worship as one chooses.&nbsp;And instead of 
		claiming God for our side, we remember 
		<a href="../abrahamlincolnsecondinauguraladdress.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Lincoln’s words</font></a>, and always pray 
		to be on the side of God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're a nation that is 
		dedicated to the proposition that all men and women are created equal.&nbsp; 
		We live that truth within our military, and see it in the varied 
		backgrounds of those we lay to rest today.&nbsp;We defend that truth at home 
		and abroad, and we know that Americans will always be found on the side 
		of liberty and equality.&nbsp;That's who we are as a people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tomorrow is Veterans 
		Day.&nbsp;It's a chance to pause, and to pay tribute -- for students to learn 
		the struggles that preceded them; for families to honor the service of 
		parents and grandparents; for citizens to reflect upon the sacrifices 
		that have been made in pursuit of a more perfect union.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For history is filled with 
		heroes.&nbsp;You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marched across 
		Europe; an uncle who fought in Vietnam; a sister who served in the 
		Gulf.&nbsp;But as we honor the many generations who have served, all of us -- 
		every single American -- must acknowledge that this generation has more 
		than proved itself the equal of those who've come before.<sup><font color="#FF0000">1
		</font></sup>We need not look to the past 
		for greatness, because it is before our very eyes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This generation of soldiers, 
		sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen have volunteered in the 
		time of certain danger. They are part of the finest fighting force that 
		the world has ever known.&nbsp;They have served tour after tour of duty in 
		distant, different, and difficult places.&nbsp;They have stood watch in 
		blinding deserts and on snowy mountains.&nbsp;They have extended the 
		opportunity of self-government to peoples that have suffered tyranny and 
		war.&nbsp;They are men and women -- white, black, and brown -- of all faiths and 
		all stations -- all Americans, serving together to protect our people, 
		while giving others half a world away the chance to lead a better life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In today’s wars, there's not 
		always a simple ceremony that signals our troops’ success -- no 
		surrender papers to be signed, or capital to be claimed.&nbsp;But the measure 
		of the impact of these young men and women is no less great. In a 
		world of threats that no know borders, their legacy will be marked in 
		the safety of our cities and towns, and the security and opportunity 
		that's extended abroad.&nbsp;It will serve as testimony to the character of 
		those who served, and the example that all of you in uniform set for 
		America and for the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here at Fort Hood, we pay 
		tribute to 13 men and women who were not able to escape the horror of 
		war, even in the comfort of home.&nbsp;Later today at Fort Lewis, one 
		community will gather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who 
		have fallen in Afghanistan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Long after they are laid to 
		rest -- when the fighting has finished, and our nation has endured; when 
		today’s servicemen and women are veterans and their children have grown 
		-- it will be said that this generation believed under the most trying 
		of tests; believed in perseverance -- not just when it was easy, but 
		when it was hard; that they paid the price and bore the burden to secure 
		this nation, and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all 
		free peoples.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we say goodbye to those 
		who now belong to eternity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that 
		guided their service.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May God bless the memory of those that we have 
		lost.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And may God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
