		<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning, everybody. I 
		hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last week, we 
		<a href="barackobamaeconomicteamannouncement.htm"><font color="#0000FF">announced our economic team</font></a>, which is working as we speak to craft an 
		Economic Recovery Program to create jobs and grow our struggling 
		economy. Today, Vice President-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce 
		our national security team.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The national security 
		challenges we face are just as grave -- and just as urgent -- as our 
		economic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain 
		unresolved, and newly assertive powers have put strains on the 
		international system. The spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril 
		that the world’s deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. 
		Our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and 
		endangers our planet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America must also be strong 
		at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education and 
		opportunity to all our citizens, so every American can compete with anyone, 
		anywhere. And our economic power must sustain our military strength, our 
		diplomatic leverage, and our global leadership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The common thread linking 
		these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century, 
		our destiny is shared with the world's. From our markets to our 
		security, from our public health to our climate, we must act with the 
		understanding that, now more than ever, we have a stake in what happens 
		across the globe. And as we learned so painfully on 
		<a href="../../rhetoricofterrorism.htm"><font color="#0000FF">9/11</font></a>, terror cannot 
		be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last week, we were reminded 
		of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six American 
		among nearly 200 victims in Mumbai. In the world we seek, there is no 
		place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful 
		extremism. This weekend, I told 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manmohan_Singh">
		<font color="#0000FF">Prime Minister Singh</font></a> of India that Americans 
		stand with the people of India in this dark time. And I am confident 
		that India's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would 
		tear it down.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, in this uncertain 
		world, the time has come for a new beginning -- a new dawn of American 
		leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize 
		the opportunities embedded in those challenges. We will strengthen our 
		capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends. We will renew 
		old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships. We will show the 
		world once more that America is relentless in the defense of our people, 
		steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that 
		shine as a beacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and 
		unyielding hope -- because American values are America’s greatest export 
		to the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To succeed, we must pursue a 
		new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates all elements 
		of American power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and law 
		enforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example. The team 
		that we've assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In their past service and 
		plans for the future, these men and women represent all of those 
		elements of American power, and the very best of the American example. 
		They've served in uniform and as diplomats; they have worked as 
		legislators, law enforcement officials, and executives. They share my 
		pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purpose about 
		America's role as a leader in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have known 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">
		<font color="#0000FF">Hillary Clinton</font></a> 
		as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaign 
		opponent. She possesses an extraordinary intelligence and 
		a remarkable work ethic. I am proud that she will be our next Secretary 
		of State. She is an American of tremendous stature who will have my 
		complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who will 
		command respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability 
		to advance our interests around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hillary’s appointment is a 
		sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew 
		American diplomacy and restore our alliances. There is much to do -- 
		from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran and North Korea, 
		to seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, to 
		strengthening international institutions. I have no doubt that Hillary 
		Clinton is the right person to lead our State Department, and to work 
		with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda.</font></p>

		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a time when we face  
		unprecedented transition amidst two wars, I've have asked 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gates">
		<font color="#0000FF">Robert Gates</font></a> to 
		continue as Secretary of Defense, and I'm pleased that he's accepted. 
		Two years ago, he took over the Pentagon at a difficult time. He 
		restored accountability. He won the confidence of military commanders 
		and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, as well as their families. 
		He earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle 
		for his pragmatism and competence. He knows that we need a sustainable 
		national security strategy -- and that includes a bipartisan consensus 
		at home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I said throughout the 
		campaign, I will be giving Secretary Gates and our military a new 
		mission as soon as I take office: responsibly ending the war in Iraq 
		through a successful transition to Iraqi control. We will also ensure 
		that we have the strategy and resources to succeed against al 
		Qaeda and the Taliban. As Bob said not too long ago, Afghanistan is 
		where the war on terror began, and it is where it must end. And going 
		forward, we will continue to make the investments necessary to 
		strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the 
		threats of the 21st century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder">
		<font color="#0000FF">Eric Holder</font></a> has the talent 
		and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first day on the 
		job, which is even more important in a transition that demands 
		vigilance. He has distinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a 
		senior official, and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement 
		challenges we face -- from terrorism to counter-intelligence, from white 
		collar crime to public corruption. Eric also has the 
		combination of toughness and independence that we need at the Justice 
		Department. Let me be clear: The Attorney General serves the American 
		people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people, 
		uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano">
		<font color="#0000FF">Janet Napolitano</font></a> offers the 
		experience and executive skills we need in the next Secretary of 
		Homeland Security. She has spent her career protecting people -- as a US 
		Attorney, an Attorney General, and as the Governor of Arizona. She 
		understands the need for a Department of Homeland Security that has the 
		capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe -- 
		be it manmade or natural. Janet assumes this critical 
		role having learned the lessons -- some of them painful -- of the last 
		several years, from 9/11 to Katrina. She insists on competence and 
		accountability. She knows firsthand the need to have a partner in 
		Washington that works well with state and local governments. She 
		understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border. And she 
		will be a leader who can reform a sprawling Department while 
		safeguarding our homeland.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Rice"><font color="#0000FF">Susan Rice</font></a> will take on the 
		crucial task of serving as Permanent Representative of the United States 
		to the United Nations. Susan has been a close and trusted advisor. As in 
		previous Administrations, the UN Ambassador will serve as a member of my 
		cabinet and an integral member of my team. Her background as a scholar, on 
		the National Security Council, and Assistant Secretary of State will 
		serve our nation well at the United Nations. Susan knows that the global 
		challenges we face demand global institutions that work. She shares my 
		belief that the UN is an indispensable and imperfect forum. She 
		will carry the message that our commitment to multilateral action must 
		be coupled with a commitment to reform. We need the United Nations to be more 
		effective as a venue for collective action -- against terror and 
		proliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, I am convinced that 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_James_Jones">
		<font color="#0000FF">General James Jones</font></a> is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled 
		National Security Advisor. Generations of Joneses have served heroically 
		on the battlefield -- from the beaches of Tarawa in World War II, to 
		Foxtrot Ridge in Vietnam. Jim's 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star">
		<font color="#0000FF">Silver Star </font></a>is a proud part of that 
		legacy. He will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in 
		uniform and as a diplomat. He has commanded a platoon in battle, served 
		as Supreme Allied Commander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of 
		peace in the Middle East. Jim is focused on the 
		threats of today and the future. He understands the connection between 
		energy and national security, and has worked on the frontlines of global 
		instability – from Kosovo to northern Iraq to Afghanistan. He will 
		advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the 
		government, so that we are effectively using all elements of American 
		power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am confident that this team 
		is what we need to make a new beginning for American national 
		security. This morning, we met to discuss the situation in Mumbai and 
		some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead. In 
		the coming weeks, I will be in close contact with these advisors, who 
		will be working with their counterparts in the Bush Administration to 
		make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on January 20th. 
		Given the range of threats that we face and the vulnerability that 
		can be a part of every presidential transition, I hope that we can 
		proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demand 
		confirmation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We move forward with the 
		humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women 
		protecting us on our front lines: diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners 
		of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours; FBI agents in the field, cops on the beat, prosecutors in 
		our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports. These selfless Americans 
		whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of our 
		effort. If we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and 
		promote our values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as we move forward with 
		respect for America's tradition of a bipartisan national security 
		policy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keeping our 
		nation and our people safe, we are not Republicans or 
		Democrats: We are Americans. There's no monopoly of power or wisdom in 
		either party. Together, as one nation, as one people, we can shape our 
		times instead of being shaped by them. Together, we will meet the 
		challenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope.</font></p>
