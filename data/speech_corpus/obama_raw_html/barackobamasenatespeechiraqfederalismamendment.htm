		<p align="center">
&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, I rise, first, to offer strong words 
of support for the statement that was just offered by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry"><font color="#0000FF">the distinguished Senator 
from Massachusetts</font></a>. I, as well, rise today to speak in support of the Iraq resolution 
that the Senate will consider tomorrow.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad. Last week, a suicide 
bomber stood outside a bookstore and killed 20 people. Other attacks
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/06/AR2007030600181.html">
<font color="#0000FF">killed 118 Shia pilgrims</font></a>. On Sunday, 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070309122729/http:/news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070307/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq">
<font color="#0000FF">a car bomb went off in central Baghdad, and more than 
30 people died</font></a>. And the road from the airport into Baghdad is littered with 
smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and the memories 
of our sons and daughters.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, the civil war in Iraq rages on. The insurgents have 
started to change their tactics. They hide in buildings and along the streets 
and wait for our helicopters. They've shot down at least eight U.S. helicopters in 
the last month. More of our soldiers are dying and coming home with their bodies 
broken and their nerves shattered at a VA system completely unprepared for what 
they need to rebuild their lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, it is not enough for the President to tell us 
that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve. The American people 
have been extraordinarily resolved. They've seen their sons and daughters 
killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah. They've spent hundreds of 
billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devoted to 
strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a Nation. 
The failure has not been a failure of resolve. That's not what's led us into 
chaos. It's been a failure of strategy; and it's time that the strategy 
change. There is no military solution, Mr. President, to the civil war that rages on in Iraq; 
and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solution becomes possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The news from Iraq is very bad, and it's been that 
way for at least four years. We all wish the -- that the land the President and the Vice 
President speak of exists. We wish that there was an Iraq where the insurgency was 
in the last throes, where the people work with security, where children play 
outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky. We wish for 
those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about 
in the news, to what we've experienced these long four years.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I repeat, Mr. President, there is no military solution to this war. At this point, no amount of soldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of 
someone else's civil war. The Iraqi people -- Shia, Sunni, and Kurd -- must come 
to the table and reach a political settlement themselves. If they want peace, 
they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our failed strategy in Iraq has strengthened Iran's 
strategic position, reduced U.S. credibility and influence around the world,  
placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril. These are not 
the signs of a well-laid plan. It's time for 
a profound change.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is what we're trying to do here today. We're 
saying it is time to start making plans to redeploy our troops so that they can focus 
on the wider struggle against terrorism, win the war in Afghanistan, strengthen 
our position in the Middle East, and pressure the Iraqis to reach a political 
settlement. Even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to 
accomplish what the American people asked for last November.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is 
gaining consensus. And I want to commend Senator Reid for his efforts. He took the time to 
listen -- so many of us from both Chambers of Congress could help develop this 
plan.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision in particular to begin a phased 
redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all our combat forces by March 31st, 
2008, is the right step. It's a measure the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Study_Group"><font color="#0000FF">Iraq Study Group</font></a> spoke of, an idea 
I borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill I introduced, now has more than 60 
cosponsors from House and Senate and from both sides of the aisle. They've 
supported this plan since I announced a similar plan in January.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision allows some U.S. forces to remain in 
Iraq with a clear mission to protect U.S. and coalition personnel, conduct 
counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip Iraqi forces; and that is a smart 
decision. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki">
<font color="#0000FF">President al-Maliki</font></a> spoke at a conference and warned that the violence 
in Iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked. By maintaining 
a strong presence in Iraq and the Middle East, as both my bill and the 
leadership bill does, we can ensure that the chaos does not spread.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I should also add that the decision to begin this 
phased redeployment within 120 days is a practical one. Our military options 
have been exhausted. It's time to seek a political solution to this war, and 
with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they need 
to arrive at an accommodation.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, while I strongly believe that this war never should have 
been authorized, I believe we must be as careful in ending the war as we were 
careless getting in. While I prefer my approach, as reflected in my bill, I 
believe that this new resolution does begin to point U.S. policy in Iraq and the 
region in the right 
direction. An end to the war, and achieving a political solution to Iraq's civil 
war, will not happen unless we demand it.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Peace with stability doesn't just 
happen because we wish for it. It comes when we never give in and never give up and 
never tire of working towards a life on Earth worthy of our human dignity. The 
decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment of 
great peril, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have a choice. We can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility and damaged our strategic interests in the region 
or we can turn toward the future. The road won't be smooth, and I have to say, 
Mr. President, that 
there will be risks with any approach. But this approach is our last best hope 
to end this war so we can begin to bring our troops home and begin the hard work 
of securing our country and our world from the threats that we face.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The 
<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wariniraq/gwbushiraq011007.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">President has said he will continue down the 
road towards more troops</font></a> and more of the same failed policies. The President 
sought and won authorization from Congress to wage this war from the start. But 
he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the American people, that is tired 
of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, the news from Iraq is very bad, but it can change if 
we in this Chamber say &quot;enough.&quot; Let this day be the day that begins the painful 
and difficult work of moving from this crossroad. Let this be the day that we 
begin pulling towards the future with a responsible conclusion to this painful 
chapter in our Nation's history. Mr. President, let this be the day when we finally send a 
message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.</font></p>
