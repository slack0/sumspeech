		<div class="articlePluckHidden">
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your Eminence, Vicki, Kara, Edward, Patrick, 
Curran, Caroline, members of the Kennedy family, distinguished guests, and 
fellow citizens:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today we say goodbye to the youngest 
child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remember their son Edward 
as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of 
the Democratic Party; and the lion of the U.S. Senate - a man whose name graces 
nearly one thousand laws, and who penned more than three hundred himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But those of us who loved him, and 
ache with his passing, know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held: Father. 
Brother. Husband. Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces 
and nephews, &quot;The Grand Fromage,&quot; or &quot;The Big Cheese.&quot; I, like so many others in 
the city where he worked for nearly half a century, knew him as a colleague, a 
mentor, and above all, a friend.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ted Kennedy was the baby of the 
family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became its rock. He 
was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but 
learned quickly how to brush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he 
didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old Teddy got back in and learned to sail. 
When a photographer asked the newly-elected Bobby to step back at a press 
conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy 
quipped, &quot;It'll be the same in Washington.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This spirit of resilience and good 
humor would see Ted Kennedy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will 
ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of sixteen. He saw two more taken 
violently from the country that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved 
sister, Eunice, in the final days of his own life. He narrowly survived a plane 
crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and 
experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a string of events that would 
have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Teddy to let himself 
become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat 
from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have 
blamed him for that. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he 
told us, &quot;...[I]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - and no 
exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves.&quot; Indeed, Ted was the 
&quot;Happy Warrior&quot; that the poet William Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As tempted more; more able to 
endure,</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As more exposed to suffering and 
distress;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thence, also, more alive to 
tenderness.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through his own suffering, Ted 
Kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others - the sick child 
who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the 
citizen denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or 
where she comes from. The landmark laws that he championed -- the Civil Rights 
Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's health 
care, the Family and Medical Leave Act -all have a running thread. Ted Kennedy's 
life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or special 
connections. It was to give a voice to those who were not heard; to add a rung 
to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding. He was 
given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to 
touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can still hear his voice 
bellowing through the Senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a 
veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil 
rights. And yet, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements 
never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning 
rod, that is not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it 
the prism through which his colleagues saw him. He was a product of an age when 
the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and philosophy 
from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect - a time when 
adversaries still saw each other as patriots. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's how Ted Kennedy became 
the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, but also 
by seeking compromise and common cause - not through deal-making and 
horse-trading alone, but through friendship, and kindness, and humor. There was 
the time he courted Orrin Hatch's support for the Children's Health Insurance 
Program by having his Chief of Staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrin had 
written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to 
sweeten up a crusty Republican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the 
support of a Texas Committee Chairman on an immigration bill. Teddy walked into 
a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only the Chairman that it was 
filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, 
he would inch the envelope closer to the Chairman. When they weren't, he would 
pull it back. Before long, the deal was done.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was only a few years ago, on St. 
Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate for my 
support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote. I gave 
him my pledge, but expressed my skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll 
call was over, the bill garnered the votes it needed, and then some. I looked at 
Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off. He just patted me on 
the back, and said &quot;Luck of the Irish!&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, luck had little to do 
with Ted Kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that. A few years ago, his 
father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest 
senators of all time. Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, &quot;What did Webster 
do?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But though it is Ted Kennedy's 
historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that we 
will miss. It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up 
the phone and say, &quot;I'm sorry for your loss,&quot; or &quot;I hope you feel better,&quot; or 
&quot;What can I do to help?&quot; It was the boss who was so adored by his staff that 
over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party. 
It was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own 
paintings to so many who never imagined that a U.S. Senator would take the time 
to think about someone like them. I have one of those paintings in my private 
study - a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who 
happened to admire it when Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first 
week he arrived in Washington; by the way, that's my second favorite gift from 
Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of those 
stories - the ones that often start with &quot;You wouldn't believe who called me 
today.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ted Kennedy was the father who 
looked after not only his own three children, but John's and Bobby's as well. He 
took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at 
birthdays and weddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and 
tragedy; and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his 
parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down the aisle 
and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read, &quot;On 
you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to be 
spared. We are all going to make it because you were always there with your 
love.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only did the Kennedy family make 
it because of Ted's love - he made it because of theirs; and especially because 
of the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much 
sorrow, it could not have been easy for Ted Kennedy to risk his heart again. 
That he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from 
Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would often acknowledge, 
Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and 
stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot know for certain how long 
we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us 
along the way. We cannot know God's plan for us. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What we can do is to live out our 
lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy. We can use each day to 
show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others 
with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our 
mistakes and grow from our failures. And we can strive at all costs to make a 
better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on 
our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; 
that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human 
beings.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This 
is his legacy. He once said of his brother Bobby that he need not be idealized 
or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the 
same about himself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's 
shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he 
became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his 
name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who 
persevered through pain and tragedy - not for the sake of ambition or vanity; 
not for wealth or power; but only for the people and the country he loved.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the days after September 11th, 
Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families of this 
state who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept 
calling and checking up on them. He fought through red tape to get them 
assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing, played with their 
children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that 
terrible day came along. To one widow, he wrote the following:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;As you know so well, the passage of 
time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, 
because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because there is 
still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We carry on. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ted Kennedy has gone home now, 
guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost. At last he 
is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the 
memories he gave, the good he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, 
enduring image - the image of a man on a boat; white mane tousled; smiling 
broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on 
toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God Bless Ted 
Kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace.</font></p></div>
