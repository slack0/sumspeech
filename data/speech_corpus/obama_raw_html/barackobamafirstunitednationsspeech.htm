		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000">[as prepared 
		for delivery]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Good morning.&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and 
		gentlemen, it is my honor to address you for the first time as the 44th 
		President of the United States.&nbsp; I -- I come before you humbled by the 
		responsibility that the American people have placed upon me, mindful of 
		the enormous challenges of our moment in history, and determined to act 
		boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and 
		abroad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I have been in office for 
		just nine months -- though some days it seems a lot longer.&nbsp; I am well 
		aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the 
		world.&nbsp; These expectations are not about me.&nbsp; Rather, they are rooted, I 
		believe, in a discontent with a status quo that has allowed us to be 
		increasingly defined by our differences, and outpaced by our problems.&nbsp; 
		But they are also rooted in hope -- the hope that real change is 
		possible, and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about 
		such change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I took office at a time when 
		many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and 
		distrust.&nbsp; Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation 
		about my country.&nbsp; Part of this was due to opposition to specific 
		policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has 
		acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others.&nbsp; And 
		this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has 
		served as an excuse for collective inaction.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, like all of you, my 
		responsibility is to act in the interest of my nation and my people, and 
		I will never apologize for defending those interests.&nbsp; But it is my 
		deeply held belief that in the year 2009 -- more than at any point in 
		human history -- the interests of nations and peoples are shared.&nbsp; The 
		religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds 
		among people, or they can tear us apart.&nbsp; The technology we harness can 
		light the path to peace, or forever darken it.&nbsp; The energy we use can 
		sustain our planet, or destroy it.&nbsp; What happens to the hope of a single 
		child -- anywhere -- can enrich our world, or impoverish it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In this hall, we come from 
		many places, but we share a common future.&nbsp; No longer do we have the 
		luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we 
		must do together.&nbsp; I have carried this message from London to Ankara; 
		from Port of Spain to Moscow; from Accra to Cairo; and it is what I will 
		speak about today -- because the time has come for the world to move in 
		a new direction.&nbsp; We must embrace a new era of engagement based on 
		mutual interest and mutual respect, and our work must begin now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We know the future will be 
		forged by deeds and not simply words.&nbsp; Speeches alone will not solve our 
		problems -- it will take persistent action.&nbsp; For those who question the 
		character and cause of my nation, I ask you to look at the concrete 
		actions we have taken in just nine months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On my first day in office, I 
		prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture by 
		the United States of America.&nbsp; I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay 
		closed, and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat 
		extremism within the rule of law.&nbsp; Every nation must know: America will 
		live its values, and we will lead by example.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We have set a clear and 
		focused goal:&nbsp; to work with all members of this body to disrupt, 
		dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies -- a network 
		that has killed thousands of people of many faiths and nations, and that 
		plotted to blow up this very building.&nbsp; In Afghanistan and Pakistan, we 
		and many nations here are helping these governments develop the capacity 
		to take the lead in this effort, while working to advance opportunity 
		and security for their people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In Iraq, we are responsibly 
		ending a war.&nbsp; We have removed American combat brigades from Iraqi 
		cities, and set a deadline of next August to remove all our combat 
		brigades from Iraqi territory.&nbsp; And I have made clear that we will help 
		Iraqis transition to full responsibility for their future, and keep our 
		commitment to remove all American troops by the end of 2011.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I have outlined a 
		comprehensive agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear 
		weapons.&nbsp; In Moscow, the United States and Russia announced that we 
		would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic warheads and 
		launchers.&nbsp; At the Conference on Disarmament, we agreed on a work plan 
		to negotiate an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear 
		weapons.&nbsp; And this week, my Secretary of State will become the first 
		senior American representative to the annual Members Conference of the 
		Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Upon taking office, I 
		appointed a Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, and America has worked 
		steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two states -- Israel 
		and Palestine -- in which peace and security take root, and the rights 
		of both Israelis and Palestinians are respected.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		To confront climate change, we have invested $80 billion in clean 
		energy.&nbsp; We have substantially increased our fuel-efficiency standards.&nbsp; 
		We have provided new incentives for conservation, launched an energy 
		partnership across the Americas, and moved from a bystander to a leader 
		in international climate negotiations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To overcome an economic 
		crisis that touches every corner of the world, we worked with the G20 
		nations to forge a coordinated international response of over $2 
		trillion in stimulus to bring the global economy back from the brink.&nbsp; 
		We mobilized resources that helped prevent the crisis from spreading 
		further to developing countries.&nbsp; And we joined with others to launch a 
		$20 billion global food security initiative that will lend a hand to 
		those who need it most, and help them build their own capacity.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We've also re-engaged the United Nations.&nbsp; We have paid our bills.&nbsp; We 
		have joined the Human Rights Council.&nbsp; We have signed the Convention of 
		the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.&nbsp; We have fully embraced the 
		Millennium Development Goals.&nbsp; And we address our priorities here, in 
		this institution&nbsp; -- for instance, through the Security Council meeting 
		that I will chair tomorrow on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, 
		and through the issues that I will discuss today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is what we have already 
		done.&nbsp; But this is just a beginning.&nbsp; Some of our actions have yielded 
		progress.&nbsp; Some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future.&nbsp; 
		But make no mistake:&nbsp; This cannot solely be America's endeavor.&nbsp; Those 
		who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now 
		stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.&nbsp; We 
		have sought -- in word and deed -- a new era of engagement with the 
		world.&nbsp; And now is the time for all of us to take our share of 
		responsibility for a global response to global challenges.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, if we are honest with 
		ourselves, we need to admit that we are not living up to that 
		responsibility.&nbsp; Consider the course that we're on if we fail to 
		confront the status quo:&nbsp; Extremists sowing terror in pockets of the 
		world; protracted conflicts that grind on and on; genocide; mass 
		atrocities; more nations with nuclear weapons; melting ice caps and 
		ravaged populations; persistent poverty and pandemic disease.&nbsp; I say 
		this not to sow fear, but to state a fact:&nbsp; The magnitude of our 
		challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This body was founded on the 
		belief that the nations of the world could solve their problems 
		together.&nbsp; Franklin Roosevelt, who died before he could see his vision 
		for this institution become a reality, put it this way -- and I quote:&nbsp; 
		&quot;The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man, or one 
		party, or one nation….&nbsp; It cannot be a peace of large nations -- or of 
		small nations.&nbsp; It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort 
		of the whole world.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The cooperative effort of 
		the whole world.&nbsp; Those words ring even more true today, when it is not 
		simply peace, but our very health and prosperity that we hold in 
		common.&nbsp; Yet we also know that this body is made up of sovereign 
		states.&nbsp; And sadly, but not surprisingly, this body has often become a 
		forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground; a venue for 
		playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems. 
		After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point figures -- 
		point fingers and stoke divisions.&nbsp; Nothing is easier than blaming 
		others for our troubles, and absolving ourselves of responsibility for 
		our choices and our actions.&nbsp; Anybody can do that.&nbsp; Responsibility and 
		leadership in the 21st century demand more.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In an era when our destiny 
		is shared, power is no longer a zero-sum game.&nbsp; No one nation can or 
		should try to dominate another nation.&nbsp; No world order that elevates one 
		nation or group of people over another will succeed.&nbsp; No balance of 
		power among nations will hold.&nbsp; The traditional divisions between 
		nations of the South and the North make no sense in an interconnected 
		world; nor do alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a 
		long-gone Cold War.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The time has come to realize 
		that the old habits, the old arguments, are irrelevant to the challenges 
		faced by our people. They lead nations to act in opposition to the very 
		goals that they claim to pursue -- and to vote, often in this body, 
		against the interests of their own people.&nbsp; They build up walls between 
		us and the future that our people seek, and the time has come for those 
		walls to come down.&nbsp; Together, we must build new coalitions that bridge 
		old divides -- coalitions of different faiths and creeds; of north and 
		south, east, west, black, white, and brown.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The choice is ours.&nbsp; We can 
		be remembered as a generation that chose to drag the arguments of the 
		20th century into the 21st; that put off hard choices, refused to look 
		ahead, failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were 
		against instead of what we were for.&nbsp; Or we can be a generation that 
		chooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead; that comes 
		together to serve the common interests of human beings, and finally 
		gives meaning to the promise embedded in the name given to this 
		institution:&nbsp; the United Nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That is the future America 
		wants -- a future of peace and prosperity that we can only reach if we 
		recognize that all nations have rights, but all nations have 
		responsibilities as well.&nbsp; That is the bargain that makes this work.&nbsp; 
		That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, let me put forward 
		four pillars that I believe are fundamental to the future that we want 
		for our children:&nbsp; non-proliferation and disarmament; the promotion of 
		peace and security; the preservation of our planet; and a global economy 
		that advances opportunity for all people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First, we must stop the 
		spread of nuclear weapons, and seek the goal of a world without them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This institution was founded 
		at the dawn of the atomic age, in part because man's capacity to kill 
		had to be contained.&nbsp; For decades, we averted disaster, even under the 
		shadow of a superpower stand-off.&nbsp; But today, the threat of 
		proliferation is growing in scope and complexity.&nbsp; If we fail to act, we 
		will invite nuclear arms races in every region, and the prospect of wars 
		and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">A fragile consensus stands 
		in the way of this frightening outcome, and that is the basic bargain 
		that shapes the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.&nbsp; It says that all 
		nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy; that nations with 
		nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament; and 
		those without them have the responsibility to forsake them.&nbsp; The next 12 
		months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be 
		strengthened or will slowly dissolve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">America intends to keep our 
		end of the bargain.&nbsp; We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to 
		substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launchers.&nbsp; We will move 
		forward with ratification of the Test Ban Treaty, and work with others 
		to bring the treaty into force so that nuclear testing is permanently 
		prohibited.&nbsp; We will complete a Nuclear Posture Review that opens the 
		door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And we 
		will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to 
		end the production of fissile material for weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I will also host a summit 
		next April that reaffirms each nation's responsibility to secure nuclear 
		material on its territory, and to help those who can't -- because we 
		must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a 
		violent extremist.&nbsp; And we will work to strengthen the institutions and 
		initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All of this must support 
		efforts to strengthen the NPT.&nbsp; Those nations that refuse to live up to 
		their obligations must face consequences.&nbsp; Let me be clear, this is not 
		about singling out individual nations -- it is about standing up for the 
		rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities.&nbsp; 
		Because a world in which IAEA inspections are avoided and the United 
		Nation's demands are ignored will leave all people less safe, and all 
		nations less secure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In their actions to date, 
		the governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this 
		dangerous slope.&nbsp; We respect their rights as members of the community of 
		nations.&nbsp; I've said before and I will repeat, I am committed to 
		diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace 
		for both nations if they live up to their obligations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But if the governments of 
		Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they 
		put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the 
		security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to 
		the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the 
		Middle East -- then they must be held accountable.&nbsp; The world must stand 
		together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise, 
		and that treaties will be enforced.&nbsp; We must insist that the future does 
		not belong to fear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That brings me to the second 
		pillar for our future:&nbsp; the pursuit of peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The United Nations was born 
		of the belief that the people of the world can live their lives, raise 
		their families, and resolve their differences peacefully.&nbsp; And yet we 
		know that in too many parts of the world, this ideal remains an 
		abstraction -- a distant dream.&nbsp; We can either accept that outcome as 
		inevitable, and tolerate constant and crippling conflict, or we can 
		recognize that the yearning for peace is universal, and reassert our 
		resolve to end conflicts around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That effort must begin with 
		an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men, women and 
		children will never be tolerated.&nbsp; On this, no one can be -- there can 
		be no dispute.&nbsp; The violent extremists who promote conflict by 
		distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves.&nbsp; They offer 
		nothing but hatred and destruction.&nbsp; In confronting them, America will 
		forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists, share intelligence, and 
		coordinate law enforcement and protect our people.&nbsp; We will permit no 
		safe haven for al Qaeda to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other 
		nation.&nbsp; We will stand by our friends on the front lines, as we and many 
		nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow.&nbsp; 
		And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths, 
		and new partnerships for opportunity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Our efforts to promote 
		peace, however, cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists.&nbsp; For 
		the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings -- 
		the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not 
		destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that is why we will 
		support -- we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping, 
		while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take 
		hold.&nbsp; We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan through support for the 
		people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
		Agreement, so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people 
		deserve.&nbsp;And in countries ravaged by violence -- from 
		Haiti to Congo to East Timor -- we will work with the U.N. and other 
		partners to support an enduring peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I will also continue to seek 
		a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab world.&nbsp; 
		We will continue to work on that issue.&nbsp; Yesterday, I had a constructive 
		meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.&nbsp; We have made 
		some progress.&nbsp; Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on 
		security.&nbsp; Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the 
		Palestinians.&nbsp; As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy 
		in the West Bank has begun to grow.&nbsp; But more progress is needed.&nbsp; We 
		continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and 
		we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of 
		continued Israeli settlements.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The time has come -- the 
		time has come to re-launch negotiations without preconditions that 
		address the permanent status issues:&nbsp; security for Israelis and 
		Palestinians, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem.&nbsp; And the goal is clear:&nbsp; 
		Two states living side by side in peace and security -- a Jewish state 
		of Israel, with true security for all Israelis; and a viable, 
		independent Palestinian state with contiguous territory that ends the 
		occupation that began in 1967, and realizes the potential of the 
		Palestinian people.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As we pursue this goal, we 
		will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria, and 
		a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbors.&nbsp; In pursuit of 
		that goal, we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral 
		participation, alongside bilateral negotiations.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		Now, I am not naïve.&nbsp; I know this will be difficult.&nbsp; But all of us -- 
		not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us -- must decide 
		whether we are serious about peace, or whether we will only lend it lip 
		service.&nbsp; To break the old patterns, to break the cycle of insecurity 
		and despair, all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in 
		private.&nbsp; The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple 
		an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel 
		respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians.&nbsp;And -- 
		And nations within this body do the Palestinians no 
		favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over 
		constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right 
		to exist in peace and security. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We must remember that the 
		greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us.&nbsp; It's not paid by 
		politicians.&nbsp; It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her 
		eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the 
		night.&nbsp; It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean 
		water and no country to call his own.&nbsp; These are all God's children.&nbsp; 
		And after all the politics and all the posturing, this is about the 
		right of every human being to live with dignity and security.&nbsp; That is a 
		lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of 
		Earth the Holy Land.&nbsp; And that is why, even though there will be 
		setbacks and false starts and tough days, I will not waver in my pursuit 
		of peace.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Third, we must recognize 
		that in the 21st century, there will be no peace unless we take 
		responsibility for the preservation of our planet.&nbsp; And I thank the 
		Secretary General for hosting the subject of climate change yesterday.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The danger posed by climate 
		change cannot be denied.&nbsp; Our responsibility to meet it must not be 
		deferred.&nbsp; If we continue down our current course, every member of this 
		Assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders.&nbsp; Our 
		efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and 
		resources.&nbsp; Development will be devastated by drought and famine.&nbsp; Land 
		that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear.&nbsp; Future 
		generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act; why we 
		failed to pass on -- why we failed to pass on an environment that was 
		worthy of our inheritance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that is why the days 
		when America dragged its feet on this issue are over.&nbsp; We will move 
		forward with investments to transform our energy economy, while 
		providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of 
		energy.&nbsp; We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the 
		goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050.&nbsp; We will continue to 
		promote renewable energy and efficiency, and share new technologies with 
		countries around the world.&nbsp; And we will seize every opportunity for 
		progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire 
		world.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And those wealthy nations 
		that did so much damage to the environment in the 20th century must 
		accept our obligation to lead.&nbsp; But responsibility does not end there.&nbsp; 
		While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses, any 
		effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast-growing carbon 
		emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without 
		inhibiting growth.&nbsp; And any effort that fails to help the poorest 
		nations both adapt to the problems that climate change have already 
		wrought and help them travel a path of clean development simply will not 
		work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It's hard to change 
		something as fundamental as how we use energy.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; It's even 
		harder to do so in the midst of a global recession.&nbsp; Certainly, it will 
		be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first.&nbsp; But we 
		cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together.&nbsp; As we 
		head into Copenhagen, let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do 
		for the sake of our common future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And this leads me to the 
		final pillar that must fortify our future:&nbsp; a global economy that 
		advances opportunity for all people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The world is still 
		recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.&nbsp; 
		In America, we see the engine of growth beginning to churn, and yet many 
		still struggle to find a job or pay their bills.&nbsp; Across the globe, we 
		find promising signs, but little certainty about what lies ahead.&nbsp; And 
		far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises 
		that challenge our humanity -- the despair of an empty stomach; the 
		thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child 
		dying from a treatable disease; or a mother losing her life as she gives 
		birth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In Pittsburgh, we will work 
		with the world's largest economies to chart a course for growth that is 
		balanced and sustained.&nbsp; That means vigilance to ensure that we do not 
		let up until our people are back to work.&nbsp; That means taking steps to 
		rekindle demand so that global recovery can be sustained.&nbsp; And that 
		means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all 
		financial centers, so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and 
		the abuse that led us into this disaster, and prevent a crisis like this 
		from ever happening again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">At a time of such 
		interdependence, we have a moral and pragmatic interest, however, in 
		broader questions of development -- the questions of development that 
		existed even before this crisis happened.&nbsp; And so America will continue 
		our historic effort to help people feed themselves.&nbsp; We have set aside 
		$63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS, to end deaths 
		from tuberculosis and malaria, to eradicate polio, and to strengthen 
		public health systems.&nbsp; We are joining with other countries to 
		contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization.&nbsp; We will 
		integrate more economies into a system of global trade.&nbsp; We will support 
		the Millennium Development Goals, and approach next year's summit with a 
		global plan to make them a reality.&nbsp; And we will set our sights on the 
		eradication of extreme poverty in our time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now is the time for all of 
		us to do our part.&nbsp; Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all 
		nations embrace their responsibilities.&nbsp; And that means that wealthy 
		nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those 
		with less, while reforming international institutions to give more 
		nations a greater voice.&nbsp; And developing nations must root out the 
		corruption that is an obstacle to progress -- for opportunity cannot 
		thrive where individuals are oppressed and business have to pay bribes.&nbsp; 
		That is why we support honest police and independent judges; civil 
		society and a vibrant private sector.&nbsp; Our goal is simple:&nbsp; a global 
		economy in which growth is sustained, and opportunity is available to 
		all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, the changes that I've 
		spoken about today will not be easy to make.&nbsp; And they will not be 
		realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this, 
		as useful as that may be.&nbsp; For as in any assembly of members, real 
		change can only come through the people we represent.&nbsp; That is why we 
		must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own 
		capitals. That's where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and 
		to harness technology for peaceful purposes, to change the way we use 
		energy, and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I believe that the people of 
		the world want this future for their children.&nbsp; And that is why we must 
		champion those principles which ensure that governments reflect the will 
		of the people.&nbsp; These principles cannot be afterthoughts -- democracy 
		and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I've 
		discussed today, because governments of the people and by the people are 
		more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people, rather 
		than narrow interests of those in power.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The test of our leadership 
		will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our 
		people.&nbsp; True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle 
		dissent, or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home.&nbsp; The 
		people of the world want change.&nbsp; They will not long tolerate those who 
		are on the wrong side of history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This Assembly's Charter 
		commits each of us -- and I quote -- &quot;to reaffirm faith in fundamental 
		human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal 
		rights of men and women.&quot;&nbsp; Among those rights is the freedom to speak 
		your mind and worship as you please; the promise of equality of the 
		races, and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own 
		potential; the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are 
		governed, and to have confidence in the administration of justice.&nbsp; For 
		just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another 
		nation, no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their 
		own people.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As an African American, I 
		will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady 
		pursuit of a more perfect union in my country.&nbsp; And that guides my 
		belief that no matter how dark the day may seem, transformative change 
		can be forged by those who choose to side with justice.&nbsp; And I pledge 
		that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity 
		and their rights -- for the student who seeks to learn; the voter who 
		demands to be heard; the innocent who longs to be free; the oppressed 
		who yearns to be equal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Democracy cannot be imposed 
		on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own 
		path, and no path is perfect.&nbsp; Each country will pursue a path rooted in 
		the culture of its people and in its past traditions.&nbsp; And I admit that 
		America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy.&nbsp; But 
		that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it.&nbsp; There are 
		basic principles that are universal; there are certain truths which are 
		self-evident -- and the United States of America will never waver in our 
		efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine 
		their own destiny.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Sixty-five years ago, a 
		weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth and 
		final inaugural address. After years of war, he sought to sum up the 
		lessons that could be drawn from the terrible suffering, the enormous 
		sacrifice that had taken place.&nbsp; &quot;We have learned,&quot; he said, &quot;to be 
		citizens of the world, members of the human community.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The United Nations was built 
		by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world -- from 
		Africa and Asia, from Europe to the Americas.&nbsp; These architects of 
		international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but naïve -- 
		it was rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war; rooted in the wisdom 
		that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of 
		splitting apart.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now it falls to us -- for 
		this institution will be what we make of it.&nbsp; The United Nations does 
		extraordinary good around the world -- feeding the hungry, caring for 
		the sick, mending&nbsp; places that have been broken.&nbsp; But it also struggles 
		to enforce its will, and to live up to the ideals of its founding.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I believe that those 
		imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution -- 
		they are a calling to redouble our efforts.&nbsp; The United Nations can 
		either be a place where we bicker about outdated grievances, or forge 
		common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart, or what 
		brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny, or a source of 
		moral authority.&nbsp; In short, the United Nations can be an institution 
		that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens, or 
		it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the 
		people we serve.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We have reached a pivotal 
		moment.&nbsp; The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of 
		international cooperation -- one that recognizes the rights and 
		responsibilities of all nations.&nbsp; And so, with confidence in our cause, 
		and with a commitment to our values, we call on all nations to join us 
		in building the future that our people so richly deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.</font></p>
