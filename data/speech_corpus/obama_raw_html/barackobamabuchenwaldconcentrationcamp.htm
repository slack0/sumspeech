&nbsp;</p>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chancellor Merkel and I 
			have just finished our tour here at Buchenwald. I want to thank Dr. 
			Volkhard Knigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were 
			witnessing. I am particularly grateful to be accompanied by my 
			friend Elie Wiesel, as well as Mr. Bertrand Herz, both of whom are 
			survivors of this place.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We saw the area known as 
			Little Camp where Elie and Bertrand were sent as boys. In fact, at 
			the place that commemorates this camp, there is a photograph in 
			which we can see a 16-year-old Elie in one of the bunks along with 
			the others. We saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, 
			the barbed wire fences, the foundations of barracks that once held 
			people in the most unimaginable conditions.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We saw the memorial to 
			all the survivors -- a steel plate, as Chancellor Merkel said, that 
			is heated to 37 degrees Celsius, the temperature of the human body; 
			a reminder -- where people were deemed inhuman because of their 
			differences -- of the mark that we all share.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now these sights have 
			not lost their horror with the passage of time. As we were walking 
			up, Elie said, &quot;if these trees could talk.&quot; And there's a certain 
			irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror that took 
			place here.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More than half a century 
			later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not 
			diminished. I will not forget what I've seen here today.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've known about this 
			place since I was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who 
			was a very young man serving in World War II. He was part of the 
			89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach a concentration 
			camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald's sub-camps.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I told this story, 
			he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and 
			isolating himself for months on end from family and friends, alone 
			with the painful memories that would not leave his head. And as we 
			see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that 
			someone who witnessed what had taken place here would be in a state 
			of shock.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My great uncle's 
			commander, General Eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence. 
			He had seen the piles of bodies and starving survivors and 
			deplorable conditions that the American soldiers found when they 
			arrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be 
			too stunned to speak about them or be able -- be unable to find the 
			words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way 
			my great uncle had. And he knew that what had happened here was so 
			unthinkable that after the bodies had been taken away, that perhaps 
			no one would believe it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why he 
			ordered American troops and Germans from the nearby town to tour the 
			camp. He invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness and 
			ordered photographs and films to be made. And he insisted on viewing 
			every corner of these camps so that -- and I quote -- he could &quot;be 
			in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever in 
			the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations 
			merely to propaganda.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today 
			because we know this work is not yet finished. To this day, there 
			are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened -- a denial 
			of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful. This 
			place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our 
			duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also to this day, there 
			are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, 
			anti-Semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred 
			that degrades its victims and diminishes us all. In this century, 
			we've seen genocide. We've seen mass graves and the ashes of 
			villages burned to the ground; children used as soldiers and rape 
			used as a weapon of war. This places teaches us that we must be ever 
			vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must 
			reject the false comfort that others' suffering is not our problem 
			and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others 
			to serve their own interests.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as we reflect today 
			on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, 
			we're also reminded of the human capacity for good. For amidst the 
			countless acts of cruelty that took place here, we know that there 
			were many acts of courage and kindness, as well. The Jews who 
			insisted on fasting on Yom Kippur. The camp cook who hid potatoes in 
			the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellow 
			inmates, risking his own life to help save theirs. The prisoners who 
			organized a special effort to protect the children here, sheltering 
			them from work and giving them extra food. They set up secret 
			classrooms, some of the inmates, and taught history and math and 
			urged the children to think about their future professions. And we 
			were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony 
			that the base for the resistance was in the latrine areas because 
			the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there. And so 
			out of the filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could 
			thrive.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the American GIs 
			arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still 
			alive, and the youngest was just three years old. And I'm told that 
			a couple of the prisoners even wrote a Buchenwald song that many 
			here sang. Among the lyrics were these: &quot;...whatever our fate, we 
			will say yes to life, for the day will come when we are free...in 
			our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts 
			-- faith.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These individuals never 
			could have known the world would one day speak of this place. They 
			could not have known that some of them would live to have children 
			and grandchildren who would grow up hearing their stories and would 
			return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and 
			the clock tower set permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They could not have 
			known how the nation of Israel would rise out of the destruction of 
			the Holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great 
			nation and my own. And they could not have known that one day an 
			American President would visit this place and speak of them and that 
			he would do so standing side by side with the German Chancellor in a 
			Germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued American ally.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They could not have 
			known these things. But still surrounded by death they willed 
			themselves to hold fast to life. In their hearts they still had 
			faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is 
			unknowable it arches towards progress, and that the world would one 
			day remember them. And it is now up to us, the living, in our work, 
			wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and 
			indifference in whatever forms they may take, and ensure that those 
			who were lost here did not go in vain. It is up to us to redeem that 
			faith. It is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world 
			continues to note what happened here; to remember all those who 
			survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just 
			as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed 
			just like us.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as we identify 
			with the victims, it's also important for us I think to remember 
			that the perpetrators of such evil were human, as well, and that we 
			have to guard against cruelty in ourselves. And I want to express 
			particular thanks to Chancellor Merkel and the German people, 
			because it's not easy to look into the past in this way and 
			acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that 
			they will stand guard against acts like this happening again.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than have me end 
			with my remarks I thought it was appropriate to have Elie Wiesel 
			provide some reflection and some thought as he returns here so many 
			years later to the place where his father died.</font></div>
