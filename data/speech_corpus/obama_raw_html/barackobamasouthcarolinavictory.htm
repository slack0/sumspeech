		&nbsp;<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you, South Carolina.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you to the rock of my life, Michelle Obama. Thank you to Malia and Sasha 
		Obama, who haven't seen their daddy in a week. Thank you to Pete 
		Skidmore for his outstanding service to our country and being such a 
		great supporter of this campaign.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You know, over two weeks ago 
		we saw the people of Iowa proclaim that our time for change has come. 
		But there were those who doubted this country's desire for something 
		new, who said Iowa was a fluke, not to be repeated again. Well, tonight 
		the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of Iowa was just an 
		illusion were told a different story by the good people of South 
		Carolina.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After four great contests in 
		every corner of this country, we have the most votes, the most delegates 
		-- and the most diverse coalition of Americans that we've seen in a 
		long, long time. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You can see it in the faces 
		here tonight. There are young and old, rich and poor. They are black and 
		white, Latino and Asian and Native American. They are Democrats from Des 
		Moines and independents from Concord and, yes, some Republicans from 
		rural Nevada. And we've got young people all across this country who've 
		never had a reason to participate until now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And in nine days, in nine 
		short days, nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in 
		saying that we are tired of business as usual in Washington. We are 
		hungry for change, and we are ready to believe again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But if there's anything, 
		though, that we've been reminded of since Iowa, it's that the kind of 
		change we seek will not come easy. Now, partly because we have fine 
		candidates in this field, fierce competitors who are worthy of our 
		respect and our admiration -- and as contentious as this campaign may 
		get, we have to remember that this is a contest for the Democratic 
		nomination and that all of us share an abiding desire to end the 
		disastrous policies of the current administration.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But there are real 
		differences between the candidates. We are looking for more than just a 
		change of party in the White House. We're looking to fundamentally 
		change the status quo in Washington. It's a status quo that extends 
		beyond any particular party. And right now that status quo is fighting 
		back with everything it's got, with the same old tactics that divide and 
		distract us from solving the problems people face, whether those 
		problems are health care that folks can't afford or a mortgage they 
		cannot pay. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So this will not be easy. 
		Make no mistake about what we're up against. We're up against the belief 
		that it's all right for lobbyists to dominate our government, that they 
		are just part of the system in Washington. But we know that the undue 
		influence of lobbyists is part of the problem, and this election is our 
		chance to say that we are not going to let them stand in our way 
		anymore.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We're up against the 
		conventional thinking that says your ability to lead as president comes 
		from longevity in Washington or proximity to the White House. But we 
		know that real leadership is about candor and judgment and the ability 
		to rally Americans from all walks of life around a common purpose, a 
		higher purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We're up against decades of 
		bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents 
		instead of coming together to make college affordable or energy cleaner. 
		It's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that 
		a Republican had an idea, even if it's one you never agreed with. That's 
		the kind of politics that is bad for our party. It is bad for our 
		country. And this is our chance to end it once and for all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We're up against the idea 
		that it's acceptable to say anything and do anything to win an election. 
		But we know that this is exactly what's wrong with our politics. This is 
		why people don't believe what their leaders say anymore. This is why 
		they tune out. And this election is our chance to give the American 
		people a reason to believe again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But let me say this, South 
		Carolina. What we've seen in these last weeks is that we're also up 
		against forces that are not the fault of any one campaign but feed the 
		habits that prevent us from being who we want to be as a nation. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It's a politics that uses 
		religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon, a politics that tells 
		us that we have to think, act, and even vote within the confines of the 
		categories that supposedly define us, the assumption that young people 
		are apathetic, the assumption that Republicans won't cross over, the 
		assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor and that the poor 
		don't vote, the assumption that African-Americans can't support the 
		white candidate, whites can't support the African-American candidate, 
		blacks and Latinos cannot come together. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are here tonight to say 
		that that is not the America we believe in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I did not travel around this 
		state over the last year and see a white South Carolina or a black South 
		Carolina. I saw South Carolina -- because in the end, we're not up just 
		against the ingrained and destructive habits of Washington. We're also 
		struggling with our own doubts, our own fears, our own cynicism. The 
		change we seek has always required great struggle and great sacrifice. 
		And so this is a battle in our own hearts and minds about what kind of 
		country we want and how hard we're willing to work for it. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So let me remind you tonight 
		that change will not be easy. Change will take time. There will be 
		setbacks and false starts, and sometimes we'll make mistakes. But as 
		hard as it may seem, we cannot lose hope, because there are people all 
		across this great nation who are counting on us, who can't afford 
		another four years without health care. They can't afford another four 
		years without good schools. They can't afford another four years without 
		decent wages because our leaders couldn't come together and get it done.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Theirs are the stories and 
		voices we carry on from South Carolina -- the mother who can't get 
		Medicaid to cover all the needs of her sick child. She needs us to pass 
		a health care plan that cuts costs and makes health care available and 
		affordable for every single American. That's what she's looking for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The teacher who works 
		another shift at Dunkin' Donuts after school just to make ends meet -- 
		she needs us to reform our education system so that she gets better pay 
		and more support and that students get the resources that they need to 
		achieve their dreams. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Maytag worker who's now 
		competing with his own teenager for a $7-an-hour job at the local 
		Wal-Mart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors -- he 
		needs us to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs 
		overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans who 
		deserve it -- and put them in the pockets of struggling homeowners who 
		are having a tough time, and looking after seniors who should retire 
		with dignity and respect. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That woman who told me that 
		she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, 
		or the soldier who doesn't know his child because he's on his third or 
		fourth or even fifth tour of duty -- they need us to come together and 
		put an end to a war that should have never been authorized and should 
		have never been waged.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So understand this, South 
		Carolina. The choice in this election is not between regions or 
		religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor, young versus old, 
		and it is not about black versus white.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This election is about the 
		past versus the future. It's about whether we settle for the same 
		divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today or 
		whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation, a 
		politics of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are those who will 
		continue to tell us that we can't do this, that we can't have what we're 
		looking for, that we can't have what we want, that we're peddling false 
		hopes. But here's what I know. I know that when people say we can't 
		overcome all the big money and influence in Washington, I think of that 
		elderly woman who sent me a contribution the other day, an envelope that 
		had a money order for $3.01 -- along with a verse of Scripture tucked 
		inside the envelope. So don't tell us change isn't possible. That woman 
		knows change is possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When I hear the cynical talk 
		that blacks and whites and Latinos can't join together and work 
		together, I'm reminded of the Latino brothers and sisters I organized 
		with and stood with and fought with side by side for jobs and justice on 
		the streets of Chicago. So don't tell us change can't happen.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When I hear that we'll never 
		overcome the racial divide in our politics, I think about that 
		Republican woman who used to work for Strom Thurmond, who's now devoted 
		to educating inner-city children, and who went out into the streets of 
		South Carolina and knocked on doors for this campaign. Don't tell me we 
		can't change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, we can. Yes, we can 
		change. Yes, we can. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, we can heal this 
		nation. Yes, we can seize our future. And as we leave this great state 
		with a new wind at our backs, and we take this journey across this great 
		country, a country we love, with the message we've carried from the 
		plains of Iowa to the hills of New Hampshire, from the Nevada desert to 
		the South Carolina coast, the same message we had when we were up and 
		when we were down, that out of many we are one, that while we breathe we 
		will hope, and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and 
		those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless 
		creed that sums up the spirit of the American people in three simple 
		words: Yes, we can. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you, South Carolina. I 
		love you.</font></p>
