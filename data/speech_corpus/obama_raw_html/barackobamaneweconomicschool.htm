		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning. It is a 
			great honor for me to join you at the New Economic School. Michelle 
			and I are so pleased to be in Moscow. And as somebody who was born 
			in Hawaii, I'm glad to be here in July instead of January.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that NES is a 
			young school, but I speak to you today with deep respect for 
			Russia's timeless heritage. Russian writers have helped us 
			understand the complexity of the human experience, and recognize 
			eternal truths. Russian painters, composers, and dancers have 
			introduced us to new forms of beauty. Russian scientists have cured 
			disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go to 
			space.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are contributions 
			that are not contained by Russia's borders, as vast as those borders 
			are. Indeed, Russia's heritage has touched every corner of the 
			world, and speaks to the humanity that we share. That includes my 
			own country, which has been blessed with Russian immigrants for 
			decades; we've been enriched by Russian culture, and enhanced by 
			Russian cooperation. And as a resident of Washington, D.C., I 
			continue to benefit from the contributions of Russians -- 
			specifically, from Alexander Ovechkin. We're very pleased to have 
			him in Washington, D.C.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">
			<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamamoscownes6a.jpg" width="232" height="197">
			Here at NES, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your 
			focus on economics is no less fundamental to the future of humanity. 
			As Pushkin said, &quot;Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much as 
			poetry.&quot; And today, I want particularly to speak to those of you 
			preparing to graduate. You're poised to be leaders in academia and 
			industry; in finance and government. But before you move forward, 
			it's worth reflecting on what has already taken place during your 
			young lives.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like President Medvedev 
			and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest 
			hours of the Cold War, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the 
			atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, and we reached 
			the brink of nuclear catastrophe. But you are the last generation 
			born when the world was divided. At that time, the American and 
			Soviet armies were still massed in Europe, trained and ready to 
			fight. The ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in 
			place. Competition in everything from astrophysics to athletics was 
			treated as a zero-sum game. If one person won, then the other person 
			had to lose.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then, within a few 
			short years, the world as it was ceased to be. Now, make no mistake: 
			This change did not come from any one nation. The Cold War reached a 
			conclusion because of the actions of many nations over many years, 
			and because the people of Russia and Eastern Europe stood up and 
			decided that its end would be peaceful.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the end of the Cold 
			War, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for 
			prosperity; for new arrangements among nations, and new 
			opportunities for individuals. Like all periods of great change, it 
			was a time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities. But, of 
			course, things don't always work out exactly as planned. Back in 
			1993, shortly after this school opened, one NES student summed up 
			the difficulty of change when he told a reporter, and I quote him: 
			&quot;The real world is not so rational as on paper.&quot; The real world is 
			not so rational as on paper.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over two tumultuous 
			decades, that truth has been borne out around the world. Great 
			wealth has been created, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of 
			crushing poverty. Poverty exists here, it exists in the United 
			States, and it exists all around the world. More people have gone to 
			the ballot box, but too many governments still fail to protect the 
			rights of their people. Ideological struggles have diminished, but 
			they've been replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and 
			religion. A human being with a computer can hold the same amount of 
			information stored in the Russian State Library, but that technology 
			can also be used to do great harm.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a new Russia, the 
			disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the 
			end of the Soviet Union brought both opportunity and hardship. A few 
			prospered, but many more did not. There were tough times. But the 
			Russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved 
			hard-earned progress through a growing economy and greater 
			confidence. And despite painful times, many in Eastern Europe and 
			Russia are much better off today than 20 years ago.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We see that progress 
			here at NES -- a school founded with Western support that is now 
			distinctly Russian; a place of learning and inquiry where the test 
			of an idea is not whether it is Russian or American or European, but 
			whether it works. Above all, we see that progress in all of you -- 
			young people with a young century to shape as you see fit.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			Your lifetime coincides with this era of transition. But think about 
			the fundamental questions asked when this school was founded. What 
			kind of future is Russia going to have? What kind of future are 
			Russia and America going to have together?&nbsp; What world order will 
			replace the Cold War? Those questions still don't have clear 
			answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your 
			generation in Russia, in America, and around the world. You get to 
			decide. And while I cannot answer those questions for you, I can 
			speak plainly about the future that America is seeking.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To begin with, let me be 
			clear: America wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous Russia. This 
			belief is rooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared 
			history between our nations that goes beyond competition. Despite 
			our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of 
			the last century. Recently, I noted this when I was in Normandy -- 
			for just as men from Boston and Birmingham risked all that they had 
			to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, Soviet soldiers from 
			places like Kazan and Kiev endured unimaginable hardships to repeal 
			-- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east. As President 
			John Kennedy said, &quot;No nation in history of battle ever suffered 
			more than the Soviet Union in the Second World War.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So as we honor this 
			past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a 
			strong and vibrant Russia. Think of the issues that will define your 
			lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; access to 
			markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an 
			international system that protects sovereignty and human rights, 
			while promoting stability and prosperity. These challenges demand 
			global partnership, and that partnership will be stronger if Russia 
			occupies its rightful place as a great power.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet unfortunately, there 
			is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of 
			thinking; a conception of power that is rooted in the past rather 
			than in the future. There is the 20th century view that the United 
			States and Russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong 
			Russia or a strong America can only assert themselves in opposition 
			to one another. And there is a 19th century view that we are 
			destined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must 
			forge competing blocs to balance one another.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These assumptions are 
			wrong. In 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating 
			or demonizing other countries. The days when empires could treat 
			sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.
			<a href="barackobamacairouniversity.htm"><font color="#0000FF">As I 
			said in Cairo</font></a>, given our independence, any world order 
			that -- given our interdependence, any world order that tries to 
			elevate one nation or one group of people over another will 
			inevitably fail. The pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game 
			-- progress must be shared.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I have called 
			for a &quot;reset&quot; in relations between the United States and Russia. 
			This must be more than a fresh start between the Kremlin and the 
			White House -- though that is important and I've had excellent 
			discussions with both your President and your Prime Minister. It 
			must be a sustained effort among the American and Russian people to 
			identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation that 
			can pave the way to progress.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This will not be easy. 
			It's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former 
			adversaries, it's hard to change habits that have been ingrained in 
			our governments and our bureaucracies for decades. But I believe 
			that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, 
			Americans and Russians share common interests that form a basis for 
			cooperation.&nbsp; It is not for me to define Russia's national 
			interests, but I can tell you about America's national interests, 
			and I believe that you will see that we share common ground.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, America has an 
			interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing 
			their use.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last century, 
			generations of Americans and Russians inherited the power to destroy 
			nations, and the understanding that using that power would bring 
			about our own destruction. In 2009, our inheritance is different. 
			You and I don't have to ask whether American and Russian leaders 
			will respect a balance of terror -- we understand the horrific 
			consequences of any war between our two countries. But we do have to 
			ask this question: We have to ask whether extremists who have killed 
			innocent civilians in New York and in Moscow will show that same 
			restraint. We have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed 
			nations will protect their arsenals and refrain from using them.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the core of the 
			nuclear challenge in the 21st century. The notion that prestige 
			comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves 
			by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an 
			illusion. In the short period since the end of the Cold War, we've 
			already seen India, Pakistan, and North Korea conduct nuclear tests. 
			Without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believe that the 
			next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these 
			nuclear weapons?</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why America is 
			committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking 
			a world without nuclear weapons. That is consistent with our 
			commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That is our 
			responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers. And while 
			I know this goal won't be met soon, pursuing it provides the legal 
			and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use 
			of nuclear weapons.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're already taking 
			important steps to build this foundation. Yesterday, President 
			Medvedev and I made progress on negotiating a new treaty that will 
			substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems. We renewed 
			our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which 
			must be a right for all nations that live up to their 
			responsibilities under the NPT. And we agreed to increase 
			cooperation on nuclear security, which is essential to achieving the 
			goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we keep our own 
			commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs. 
			Whether America or Russia, neither of us would benefit from a 
			nuclear arms race in East Asia or the Middle East. That's why we 
			should be united in opposing North Korea's efforts to become a 
			nuclear power, and opposing Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear 
			weapon. And I'm pleased that President Medvedev and I agreed upon a 
			joint threat assessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic 
			missile challenges of the 21st century, including from Iran and 
			North Korea.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not about 
			singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities 
			of all nations. If we fail to stand together, then the NPT and the 
			Security Council will lose credibility, and international law will 
			give way to the law of the jungle. And that benefits no one. As I 
			said in Prague, rules must be binding, violations must be punished, 
			and words must mean something.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The successful 
			enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement. I 
			know Russia opposes the planned configuration for missile defense in 
			Europe. And my administration is reviewing these plans to enhance 
			the security of America, Europe and the world. And I've made it 
			clear that this system is directed at preventing a potential attack 
			from Iran. It has nothing to do with Russia. In fact, I want to work 
			together with Russia on a missile defense architecture that makes us 
			all safer. But if the threat from Iran's nuclear and ballistic 
			missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense 
			in Europe will be eliminated, and that is in our mutual interests.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in addition to 
			securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where 
			America has a critical national interest is in isolating and 
			defeating violent extremists.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For years, al Qaeda and 
			its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, 
			and ruthlessly murdered men, women and children of all nationalities 
			and faiths. Indeed, above all, they have murdered Muslims. And these 
			extremists have killed in Amman and Bali; Islamabad and Kabul; and 
			they have the blood of Americans and Russians on their hands. 
			They're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefit from 
			safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly 
			along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why America 
			has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its 
			allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We seek no bases, nor do we want 
			to control these nations. Instead, we want to work with 
			international partners, including Russia, to help Afghans and 
			Pakistanis advance their own security and prosperity. And that's why 
			I'm pleased that Russia has agreed to allow the United States to 
			supply our coalition forces through your territory. Neither America 
			nor Russia has an interest in an Afghanistan or Pakistan governed by 
			the Taliban. It's time to work together on behalf of a different 
			future -- a future in which we leave behind the great game of the 
			past and the conflict of the present; a future in which all of us 
			contribute to the security of Central Asia.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, beyond Afghanistan, 
			America is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate 
			extremists. We are helping the Iraqi people build a better future, 
			and leaving Iraq to the Iraqis. We're pursuing the goal of two 
			states, Israel and Palestine, living in peace and security. We're 
			partnering with Muslim communities around the world to advance 
			education, health, and economic development. In each of these 
			endeavors, I believe that the Russian people share our goals, and 
			will benefit from success -- and we need to partner together.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in addition to 
			these security concerns, the third area that I will discuss is 
			America's interest in global prosperity. And since we have so many 
			economists and future businessmen and women in the room, I know this 
			is of great interest to you.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We meet in the midst of 
			the worst global recession in a generation. I believe that the free 
			market is the greatest force for creating and distributing wealth 
			that the world has known. But wherever the market is allowed to run 
			rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or 
			corruption -- then all are endangered, whether we live on the 
			Mississippi or on the Volga.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In America, we're now 
			taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our 
			system of regulation. But just as no nation can wall itself off from 
			the consequences of a global crisis, no one can serve as the sole 
			engine of global growth. You see, during your lives, something 
			fundamental has changed. And while this crisis has shown us the 
			risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by 
			opportunity.<br>
			&nbsp;<br>
			Think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago. 
			A young woman with an Internet connection in Bangalore, India can 
			compete with anybody anywhere in the world. An entrepreneur with a 
			start-up company in Beijing can take his business global. An NES 
			professor in Moscow can collaborate with colleagues at Harvard or 
			Stanford. That's good for all of us, because when prosperity is 
			created in India, that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas 
			take hold in China, that pushes our businesses to innovate; when new 
			connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is extraordinary 
			potential for increased cooperation between Americans and Russians. 
			We can pursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the 
			wider world. We can boost investment that creates jobs in both our 
			countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only 
			traditional resources, like oil and gas, but new sources of energy 
			that will drive growth and combat climate change. All of that, 
			Americans and Russians can do together.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, government can 
			promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance 
			this cooperation, because the greatest resource of any nation in the 
			21st century is you. It's people; it's young people especially. And 
			the country which taps that resource will be the country that will 
			succeed. That success depends upon economies that function within 
			the rule of law. As President Medvedev has rightly said, a mature 
			and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic 
			development. People everywhere should have the right to do business 
			or get an education without paying a bribe. Whether they are in 
			America or Russia or Africa or Latin America, that's not a American 
			idea or a Russian idea -- that's how people and countries will 
			succeed in the 21st century.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this brings me to 
			the fourth issue that I will discuss -- America's interest in 
			democratic governments that protect the rights of their people.</font><p align="left">
			<font face="Verdana">
			<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamamoscownes3.JPG" width="241" height="182">
			</font>
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">By no means is America 
			perfect. But it is our commitment to certain universal values which 
			allows us to correct our imperfections, to improve constantly, and 
			to grow stronger over time. Freedom of speech and assembly has 
			allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and 
			equal rights at a time when they were denied. The rule of law and 
			equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut down 
			political machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power. 
			Independent media have exposed corruption at all levels of business 
			and government. Competitive elections allow us to change course and 
			hold our leaders accountable. If our democracy did not advance those 
			rights, then I, as a person of African ancestry, wouldn't be able to 
			address you as an American citizen, much less a President. Because 
			at the time of our founding, I had no rights -- people who looked 
			like me. But it is because of that process that I can now stand 
			before you as President of the United States.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So around the world, 
			America supports these values because they are moral, but also 
			because they work. The arc of history shows that governments which 
			serve their own people survive and thrive; governments which serve 
			only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of 
			their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to 
			terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments that 
			promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and 
			allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading 
			partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America's 
			most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in 
			Europe and Asia -- nations that today live with great security and 
			prosperity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now let me be clear: 
			America cannot and should not seek to impose any system of 
			government on any other country, nor would we presume to choose 
			which party or individual should run a country. And we haven't 
			always done what we should have on that front. Even as we meet here 
			today, America supports now the restoration of the 
			democratically-elected President of Honduras, even though he has 
			strongly opposed American policies. We do so not because we agree 
			with him. We do so because we respect the universal principle that 
			people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we 
			agree with or not.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that leads me to the 
			final area that I will discuss, which is America's interest in an 
			international system that advances cooperation while respecting the 
			sovereignty of all nations.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">State sovereignty must 
			be a cornerstone of international order. Just as all states should 
			have the right to choose their leaders, states must have the right 
			to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies. That 
			is true for Russia, just as it is true for the United States. Any 
			system that cedes those rights will lead to anarchy. That's why we 
			must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes 
			nations like Georgia and Ukraine. America will never impose a 
			security arrangement on another country. For any country to become a 
			member of an organization like NATO, for example, a majority of its 
			people must choose to; they must undertake reforms; they must be 
			able to contribute to the Alliance's mission. And let me be clear: 
			NATO should be seeking collaboration with Russia, not confrontation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And more broadly, we 
			need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and 
			peoples. As President of the United States, I will work tirelessly 
			to protect America's security and to advance our interests. But no 
			one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, 
			nor dictate its terms to the world. That is something that America 
			now understands, just as Russia understands. That's why America 
			seeks an international system that lets nations pursue their 
			interests peacefully, especially when those interests diverge; a 
			system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and 
			violations of those rights are opposed; a system where we hold 
			ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, with 
			clear rights and responsibilities for all.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was a time when 
			Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin could shape the world in one 
			meeting. Those days are over. The world is more complex today. 
			Billions of people have found their voice, and seek their own 
			measure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the 
			planet. Over the past two decades, we've witnessed markets grow, 
			wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy. We've 
			seen old hatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift 
			and fade away; we've seen the human destiny in the hands of more and 
			more human beings who can shape their own destinies. Now, we must 
			see that the period of transition which you have lived through 
			ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, and people 
			realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life 
			for their children. That is America's interest, and I believe that 
			it is Russia's interest as well.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that this future 
			can seem distant. Change is hard. In the words of that NES student 
			back in 1993, the real world is not so rational as on paper. But 
			think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time. One 
			hundred years ago, a czar ruled Russia, and Europe was a place of 
			empire.&nbsp; When I was born, segregation was still the law of the land 
			in parts of America, and my father's Kenya was still a colony. When 
			you were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and 
			the Internet was only known to a privileged few.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You get to decide what 
			comes next. You get to choose where change will take us, because the 
			future does not belong to those who gather armies on a field of 
			battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongs to young 
			people with an education and the imagination to create. That is the 
			source of power in this century. And given all that has happened in 
			your two decades on Earth, just imagine what you can create in the 
			years to come.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every country charts its 
			own course. Russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river 
			through a canyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it 
			goes. As you move this story forward, look to the future that can be 
			built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old 
			suspicions; look to the future that can be built if we partner on 
			behalf of the aspirations we hold in common. Together, we can build 
			a world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our 
			power truly serves progress. And it is all in your hands. Good luck 
			to all of you.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></div>
