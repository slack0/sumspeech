<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello Springfield! ...Look at all of you. Look at all 
of you. Goodness. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Giving all praise and 
honor to God for bringing us here today. Thank you so much. I am -- I am so 
grateful to see all of you. You guys are still cheering back there? [to audience 
on left.] </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me -- Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've 
traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today. I know it's a little 
chilly -- but I'm fired up. <br>
<br>
You know, we all made this journey for a reason. It's humbling to see a crowd 
like this, but in my heart I know you 
didn't just come here for me. You...came here because you believe in what this 
country can be. In the face of war, you believe there can be peace. In the face 
of despair, you believe there can be hope. In the face of a politics that shut 
you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe 
that we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that 
<a href="barackobamaperfectunion.htm"><font color="#0000FF">more perfect 
union</font></a>.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">That's the journey we're on today. But let me tell you how I came to be here. As 
most of you know, I'm not a native of this great state. I -- I moved to Illinois 
over two decades ago. I was a young man then, just a year out of college. I knew 
no one in Chicago when I arrived, was without money or family connections. But a group of 
churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for the grand sum of 13,000 
dollars a year. And I 
accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful 
idea: that I might play a small part in building a better America.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. I joined with 
pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant 
closings. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature, 
that the decisions to close a steel mill was made by distant executives, that the 
lack of textbooks and computers in a school could be traced to skewed 
priorities of politicians a thousand miles away, and that when a child turns to 
violence -- I came to realize that -- there's a hole in that boy's heart that no government alone can fill.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education 
that I ever had, and 
where I learned the meaning of my Christian faith.<br>
<br>
After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to 
understand how the law should work for those in need. I became a civil rights 
lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand 
that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active 
participation of an awakened electorate. It was with these ideas in mind that I 
arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.<br>
<br>
It -- It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge -- farmers 
and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of 
them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard. I made 
lasting friendships here, friends that I see here in the audience today.
It was here -- It was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable; that it's 
possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be 
compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can 
assume the best in people instead of the worst.<br>
<br>
That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken; that's 
why we were able to give health insurance to children in need; that's why we 
made the tax system right here in Springfield more fair and just for working families; and that's why we 
passed ethics reform that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.<br>
<br>
It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East, and West come together 
that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people -- where I 
came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where 
<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/abrahamlincolnhousedivided.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">Lincoln once 
called on a house divided to stand together</font></a>, where common hopes and common 
dreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of 
the United States of America.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now -- Now, listen,
I -- I... -- thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. </font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">[to audience chanting &quot;Obama&quot;]</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Look, I -- I...recognize that there is a certain presumptuousness 
in this, a certain audacity, to this 
announcement. I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of 
Washington. But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington 
must change.<br>
<br>
The genius of our Founders is that they designed a system of government that can 
be changed. And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before. 
In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees. In 
the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free. In the 
face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of 
poverty. We welcomed immigrants to our shores. We opened railroads to the west. 
We landed a man on the moon. And we heard a King's call to let &quot;<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm"><font color="#0000FF">justice roll down 
like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream</font></a>.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We've done this before: Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be 
done. Today we are called once more, and it is time for our generation to 
answer that call.
For that is our unyielding faith -- that in -- in the face of impossible odds, people 
who love their country can change it.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">That's what Abraham Lincoln understood. He had his doubts. He had his defeats. 
He had his skeptics. He had his setbacks. But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and 
helped free a people. It's because of the millions who rallied to his cause 
that we're no longer divided, North and South, slave and free. It's because 
men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for 
freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to 
face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people -- as Americans.<br>
<br>
All of us know what those challenges are today: a war with no end, a dependence 
on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't 
learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard 
as they can. We know the challenges. We've heard them. We've talked about them 
for years.<br>
<br>
What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound 
policies and sensible plans. What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the 
smallness -- the smallness of our politics -- the ease with which we're distracted by the petty 
and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for 
scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a 
working consensus to tackle the big problems of America.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">For the past six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter. 
We've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs 
and stagnant wages are an illusion. We've been told that climate change is a 
hoax. We've been told that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and 
strategy, and foresight. And when all else fails, when 
<a href="kathleenblancokatrina.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Katrina</font></a> happens, or the 
death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's 
fault. We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other 
Party, or gay people, or immigrants.<br>
<br>
And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know 
what's filled the void: the cynics, the lobbyists, the special interests -- 
who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play. They 
write the checks and you get stuck with the bill. They get the access while you 
get to write a letter. They think they own this government, but we're here today 
to take it back. The time for that kind of politics is over. It is through. It's time to turn the page 
-- right here and right now.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now look --</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2">[Audience chants &quot;Obama...Obama...Obama&quot;]</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Okay. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Look, look, we have made some progress already. I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress 
that led to the most sweeping ethics reforms since Watergate.
But Washington has a long way to go, and it won't be easy. That's why we'll have 
to set priorities. We'll have to make hard choices. And although government will 
play a crucial role in bringing about the changes that we need, more money and 
programs alone will not get us to where we need to go. Each of us, in our own 
lives, will have to accept responsibility -- for instilling an ethic of 
achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for 
strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">So let us 
begin. Let us begin this hard work together. Let us transform this nation.
Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital 
age. Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they 
need to succeed. Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay 
and more support in exchange for more accountability. Let's make college more 
affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down 
broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across 
America. We can do that.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's 
workers are sharing in our prosperity. Let's protect the hard-earned benefits 
their companies have promised. Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans 
to save for retirement. Let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift 
up this country's middle-class again. We can do that.<br>
<br>
Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America. Every single person 
willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn 
a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids can have a 
safe place to go when they work. We can do this.<br>
<br>
And let's be the generation that finally, after all these years, tackles our health care crisis. We can 
control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the 
chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy. Let's be the 
generation that says right here, right now: We will have universal health 
care in America by the end of the next President's first term. We can do that.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil. We 
can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of 
more fuel-efficient cars. We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases. 
We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for 
innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as 
a model for the world. Let's be the generation that makes future generations 
proud of what we did here.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets 
<a href="../rhetoricofterrorism.htm"><font color="#0000FF">what happened on that 
September day</font></a> and confront the terrorists with everything we've got. Politics 
doesn't have to divide us on this anymore; we can work together to keep our 
country safe. I've worked with the Republican Senator
<a href="http://lugar.senate.gov/"><font color="#0000FF">Dick Lugar</font></a> 
to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest weapons. We can 
work together to track down terrorists with a stronger military. We can tighten 
the net around their finances. We can improve our intelligence capabilities and 
finally get homeland security right. 
But let's also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will only 
come by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and 
opportunity to millions of people around the globe.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We can do those things.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq. 
Most of you know -- Most of you know that I opposed this war from the start. I thought it was a tragic 
mistake. Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts 
that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been. America, it is 
time to start bringing our troops home. It's time -- It's time to admit that no amount of 
American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of 
someone else's civil war. That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat 
troops home by March of 2008. Let the Iraqis know -- Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there 
forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the 
table and find peace.<br>
<br>
And there's one other thing that it's not too late to get right about this 
war, and that is the homecoming of the men and women, our veterans, who have 
sacrificed the most. Let us honor their courage by providing the care they need 
and rebuilding the military they love. Let us be the generation that begins that 
work.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things. I 
understand the skepticism. After all, every four years, candidates from both 
Parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different. All 
of us running for President will travel around the country offering ten-point 
plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we 
believe make us uniquely qualified to lead this country. But too many times, 
after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises 
fade from memory, and the lobbyists and special interests move in, and 
people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.<br>
<br>
That's why this campaign can't only be about me. It must be about us. It must 
be about what we can do together. This campaign must be the occasion, the 
vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams. It will take your time, your energy, 
and your advice to push us forward when we're doing right, and let us know 
when we're not. This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of 
citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few 
obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.<br>
<br>
By ourselves, this change will not happen. Divided, we are bound to fail.
But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a 
different future is possible.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">He tells us that there is power in words.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">He tells us that there's power in conviction.<br>
<br>
That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are 
one people.<br>
<br>
He tells us that there's power in hope.<br>
<br>
As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say 
this: 
&quot;Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four 
winds, and formed and fought to battle through.&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">¹</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
<br>
That is our purpose here today.
That is why I am in this race -- not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
I want -- I want to win that next battle -- for justice and opportunity.
I want to win that next battle -- for better schools, and better jobs, and 
better health 
care for all.
I want us to take up the <a href="barackobamaperfectunion.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">unfinished business of perfecting our union</font></a>, and 
building a better America.<br>
<br>
And if you will join with me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, 
and see as I see, the future of endless possibility stretching out before us; if you 
sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off 
our fears, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I 
am 
ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you -- today.
</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Together we can finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new 
birth of freedom on this Earth.</font></p>

work! I love you. Thank you.</font></p>
