<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio] </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you so much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Let me begin by thanking
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Wofford"><font color="#0000FF">
Harris Wofford</font></a> for his contributions to this country. In so many 
different ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word &quot;citizen.&quot; And so we are 
very grateful to him for all the work he has done; and I'm thankful for the 
gracious and thoughtful introduction.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We the people, in order to form a 
more perfect union.&quot; Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still 
stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, 
launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars, 
statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny and 
persecution finally made real their <a href="declarationofindependence.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">Declaration of Independence</font></a> at a Philadelphia 
convention that lasted through the spring of 1787.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The document they produced was 
eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation's 
original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the 
convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to 
continue for at least 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future 
generations. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded 
within our Constitution -- a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of 
equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty 
and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet words on a parchment would 
not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every 
color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United 
States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were 
willing to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and 
in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great 
risk -- to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of 
their time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was one of the tasks we set 
forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: to continue the long march 
of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, 
more caring, and more prosperous America. I chose to run for President at this 
moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges 
of our time unless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by 
understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that 
we may not look the same and may not have come from the same place, but we all 
want to move in the same direction: towards a better future for our children and 
our grandchildren. And this belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency 
and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my own story.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm the son of a black man from 
Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white 
grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's army during World War 
II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort 
Leavenworth while he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in 
America and I've lived in one of the world's poorest nations. I am married to a 
black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an 
inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, 
nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every hue scattered 
across three continents. And for as long as I live, I will never forget that in 
no other country on earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't 
made me the most conventional of candidates. But it is a story that has seared 
into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its 
parts -- that out of many, we are truly one.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now throughout the first year of 
this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the 
American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation to view 
my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states 
with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where 
the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African 
Americans and white Americans. This is not to say that race has not been an 
issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators 
have deemed me either &quot;too black&quot; or &quot;not black enough.&quot; We saw racial tensions 
bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The 
press has scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial 
polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet, it's only been in the 
last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a 
particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the 
implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that 
it's based solely on the desire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase 
racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former 
pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the 
potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the 
greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white and black 
alike.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now I've already condemned, in 
unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such 
controversy, and in some cases, pain. For some, nagging questions remain: Did I 
know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign 
policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered 
controversial while I sat in the church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many 
of his political views? Absolutely, just as I'm sure many of you have heard 
remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagree.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the remarks that have caused 
this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a 
religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, 
they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees 
white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with America above all 
that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle 
East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel instead 
of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As such, Reverend Wright's 
comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need 
unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set 
of monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a 
chronic health care crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- 
problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems 
that confront us all.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given my background, my politics, 
and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my 
statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself with Reverend 
Wright in the first place, they may ask? Why not join another church? And I 
confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those 
sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television sets and YouTube, if 
Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by 
some commentators, there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the truth is, that isn't all 
that I know of the man. The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who 
helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our 
obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor. He 
is a man who served his country as a United States Marine, and who has studied 
and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, 
and who over 30 years has led a church that serves the community by doing God's 
work here on Earth -- by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, 
providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching 
out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In my first book, <i>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreams-My-Father-Story-Inheritance/dp/1400082773">
<font color="#0000FF">Dreams From My Father</font></a></i>, I described the 
experience of my first service at Trinity, and it goes as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">People began to shout, to 
	rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the 
	reverend's voice up to the rafters.</font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">And in that single note -- 
	hope -- I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the 
	thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary 
	black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and 
	Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones.</font></i></p>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those stories of survival 
	and freedom and hope became our stories, my story. The blood that spilled 
	was our blood; the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright 
	day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future 
	generations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once 
	unique and universal, black and more than black. In chronicling our journey, 
	the stories and songs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't 
	need to feel shame about -- memories that all people might study and cherish 
	and with which we could start to rebuild.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That has been my experience at 
Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity 
embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfare mom, 
the model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, 
Trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They 
are full of dancing and clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem 
jarring to the untrained ear. The church contains in full the kindness and 
cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and 
successes, the love and, yes, the bitterness and biases that make up the black 
experience in America.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this helps explain, perhaps, my 
relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as he may be, he has been like 
family to me. He strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my 
children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any 
ethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with 
anything but courtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions -- 
the good and the bad -- of the community that he has served diligently for so 
many years.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">I can no more disown him than I can disown the 
black community. I can no more disown him than I can disown my white 
grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again 
for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a 
woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, 
and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that 
made me cringe.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">These people are part of me. And they are part of 
America, this country that I love.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, some will see this as an 
attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable. I can assure 
you it is not. And I suppose the politically safe thing to do would be to move 
on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can 
dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed 
Geraldine Ferraro in the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some 
deep -- deep-seated bias.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But race is an issue that I 
believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the 
same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America: 
to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it 
distorts reality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the 
issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of 
race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union 
that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat 
into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve 
challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every 
American.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Understanding -- Understanding 
this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point. As William 
Faulkner once wrote, &quot;The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even 
past.&quot; We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this 
country. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that 
exist between the African-American community and the larger American community 
today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier 
generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws"><font color="#0000FF">Jim 
Crow</font></a>. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools. We still 
haven't fixed them, 50 years after <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_versus_Board_of_Education">
<font color="#0000FF">Brown versus Board of Education</font></a></i>. And the 
inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive 
achievement gap between today's black and white students.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Legalized discrimination, where 
blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans 
were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could 
not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police 
force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any 
meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain 
the wealth and income gap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets 
of poverty that persist in so many of today's urban and rural communities. A 
lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that 
came from not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion 
of black families, a problem that welfare policies for many years may have 
worsened. And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods -- 
parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pick-up, 
building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle of violence, blight, and 
neglect that continues to haunt us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the reality in which 
Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up. They came 
of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was still the 
law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What's 
remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many 
men and women overcame the odds, how many were able to make a way out of no way 
for those like me who would come after them. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But for all those who scratched 
and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who 
didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by 
discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- 
those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street 
corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. 
Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue 
to define their world view in fundamental ways. For the men and women of 
Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear 
have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That anger may not get expressed 
in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, but it does find voice 
in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times, that 
anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make 
up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the 
church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many 
people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons 
simply reminds us of that old truism that the most segregated hour of American 
life occurs on Sunday morning.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That -- That anger is not always 
productive. Indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real 
problems. It keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the 
African-American community in our own condition. It prevents the 
African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about 
real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful, and to simply wish it away, 
to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm of 
misunderstanding that exists between the races.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, a similar anger exists 
within segments of the white community. Most working and middle-class white 
Americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant 
experience. As far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything; they built 
it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see 
their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. 
They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away. 
And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be 
seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their 
children to a school across town, when they hear that an African American is 
getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because 
of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they're told that 
their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment 
builds over time. 
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the anger within the black 
community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they 
have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative 
action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears 
of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative 
commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while 
dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere 
political correctness or reverse racism. And just as black anger often proved 
counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the 
real culprits of the middle class squeeze: a corporate culture rife with inside 
dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington 
dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the 
few over the many. And yet, to wish away the 
resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist 
without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns, this, too, widens 
the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is where we are right now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's 
a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of 
some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naive as to believe 
that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a 
single candidate, particularly -- particularly a candidacy as 
imperfect as my own. But I have asserted a firm 
conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American 
people, that, working together, we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds 
and that, in fact, we have no choice -- we have no choice if we are to continue 
on the path of a more perfect union. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the African-American community, 
that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of 
our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every 
aspect of American life. But it also means binding our 
particular grievances, for better health care and better schools and better 
jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans -- the white woman struggling 
to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, the immigrant 
trying to feed his family. And it means also taking full 
responsibility for our own lives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending 
more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while 
they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never 
succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe -- They must always believe that they 
can write their own destiny.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ironically, this quintessentially 
American -- and, yes, conservative -- notion of self-help found frequent 
expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. But what my former pastor too often 
failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a 
belief that society can change. The profound mistake of Reverend 
Wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. It's that he 
spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had been made, as if this 
country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run 
for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino, Asian, rich, poor, young 
and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. What we know, what we have seen, 
is that America can change. That is true 
genius of this nation. What we have already achieved gives us hope -- the 
audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, in the white community, the 
path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the 
African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; 
that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, 
while less overt than in the past -- that these things are real and must be 
addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds 
-- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil 
rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing 
this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous 
generations. It requires all Americans to realize 
that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams, that investing 
in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will 
ultimately help all of America prosper.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, then, what is called for 
is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world's great religions 
demand: that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us be our brother's keeper, 
Scripture tells us. Let us be our sister's keeper. Let us find that common stake 
we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> 
For we have a choice in this 
country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and 
cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case">
<font color="#0000FF">O.J. trial</font></a>; or in 
the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina; or as fodder for the 
nightly news. We can play Reverend Wright's 
sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the 
election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the 
American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most 
offensive words. We can pounce on some gaffe by a 
Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card; or we can 
speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general 
election regardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can 
tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other 
distraction, and then another one, and then another one. And nothing will 
change.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That is one option.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or, at this moment, in this 
election, we can come together and say, &quot;Not this time.&quot; This time we want to talk about the 
crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white 
children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native-American children.
This time we want to reject the 
cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't 
look like us are somebody else's problem. The children of America are not 
&quot;those kids,&quot; -- they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 
21st-century economy. Not this time. This time we want to talk about how 
the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics 
who do not have health care, who don't have the power on their own to overcome 
the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it 
together.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This time we want to talk about the 
shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every 
race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every 
religion, every region, every walk of life. This time we want to talk about the 
fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might 
take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for 
nothing more than a profit. This time -- This time we want to talk about the 
men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, 
and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talk about how to bring 
them home from a war that should've never been authorized and should've never 
been waged. And we want to talk about how we'll 
show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the 
benefits that they have earned.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I would not be running for President 
if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of 
Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, but generation 
after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever I find myself 
feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope 
is the next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and 
openness to change have already made history in this election.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's one story in particular that 
I'd like to leave you with today, a story I told when I had the great honor of 
speaking on Dr. King's birthday at his home church, 
<a href="http://www.historicebenezer.org/Home.html"><font color="#0000FF">Ebenezer Baptist</font></a>, in 
Atlanta. There's a young, 23-year-old woman, 
a white woman named Ashley Baia, who organized for our campaign in Florence, 
South Carolina. She'd been working to organize a 
mostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign, and one 
day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their 
story and why they were there. And Ashley said that when she was 9 
years old, her mother got cancer. And because she had to miss days of work, she 
was let go and lost her health care. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's 
when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
She knew that food was one of their 
most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really 
liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish 
sandwiches -- because that was the cheapest way to eat. That's the mind of a 9 
year old. She did this for a year until her 
mom got better. And so Ashley told everyone at the roundtable that the reason 
she had joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other 
children in the country who want and need to help their parents too. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, Ashley might have made a 
different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her 
mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or 
Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn't. She sought 
out allies in her fight against injustice. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, Ashley finishes her story 
and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the 
campaign. They all have different stories and 
different reasons. Many bring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this 
elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time. And Ashley 
asks him why he's there. And he doesn't bring up a specific 
issue. He does not say <i>health care</i> or <i>the economy</i>. He does not say 
<i>education</i> or 
<i>the war</i>. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says to everyone in the 
room, &quot;I am here because of Ashley.&quot; &quot;I'm here because of Ashley.&quot; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, by itself, that single moment 
of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not 
enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the 
jobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start. It is where our 
union grows stronger. And as so many generations have come 
to realize over the course of the 221 years since a band of patriots signed that 
document right here in Philadelphia, that is where perfection begins. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much, everyone. Thank 
you. </font></p>
