			<p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much. To Sara Bloomfield, for the wonderful 
			introduction and the outstanding work she's doing; to Fred Zeidman; 
			Joel Geiderman; Mr. Wiesel -- thank you for your wisdom and your 
			witness; Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Dick Durbin; members of 
			Congress; our good friend the Ambassador of Israel; members of the 
			United States Holocaust Memorial Council; and most importantly, the 
			survivors and rescuers and their families who are here today. It is 
			a great honor for me to be here, and I'm grateful that I have the 
			opportunity to address you briefly.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We gather today to mourn 
			the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them; honor 
			those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is the grimmest of 
			ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in 
			history began in one of the most modernized societies of its time, 
			where so many markers of human progress became tools of human 
			depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education that can 
			enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the 
			bureaucracy that sustains modern life used as the machinery of mass 
			death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient system where many were 
			responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their 
			hands.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the uniqueness of 
			the Holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, the 
			Holocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled 
			atrocities throughout history: the scapegoating that leads to hatred 
			and blinds us to our common humanity; the justifications that 
			replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of 
			those who are neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the 
			assigned role of bystander, believing the lie that good people are 
			ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But while we are here 
			today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are also 
			here to pay tribute to the human impulse to save. In the moral 
			accounting of the Holocaust, as we reckon with numbers like 6 
			million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched into arms, we 
			also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of Danish 
			Jews ferried to safety, many of whom later returned home to find the 
			neighbors who rescued them had also faithfully tended their homes 
			and businesses and belongings while they were gone.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We remember the number 
			five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today from 
			Poland. We are awed by your acts of courage and conscience. And your 
			presence today compels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would 
			have done what you did. We can only hope that the answer is yes.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also remember the 
			number 5,000 -- the number of Jews rescued by the villagers of Le 
			Chambon, France -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents. 
			Not a single Jew who came there was turned away, or turned in. But 
			it was not until decades later that the villagers spoke of what they 
			had done -- and even then, only reluctantly. The author of a book on 
			the rescue found that those he interviewed were baffled by his 
			interest. &quot;How could you call us 'good'?&quot; they said. &quot;We were doing 
			what had to be done.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the question of 
			the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good at 
			extraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance 
			their own interests, but because it is what must be done. They 
			remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- these are 
			choices we each have the power to make. They teach us that no one 
			can make us into bystanders without our consent, and that we are 
			never truly alone -- that if we have the courage to heed that 
			&quot;still, small voice&quot; within us, we can form a minyan for 
			righteousness that can span a village, even a nation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Their legacy is our 
			inheritance. And the question is, how do we honor and preserve it? 
			How do we ensure that &quot;never again&quot; isn't an empty slogan, or merely 
			an aspiration, but also a call to action?</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe we start by 
			doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting the 
			silence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the face of horrors 
			that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable. 
			My own great uncle returned from his service in World War II in a 
			state of shock, saying little, alone with painful memories that 
			would not leave his head. He went up into the attic, according to 
			the stories that I've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months. 
			He was one of the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had 
			seen the unimaginable. And so some of the liberators who are here 
			today honor us with their presence -- all of whom we honor for their 
			extraordinary service. My great uncle was part of the 89th Infantry 
			Division -- the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. 
			And they liberated Ohrdruf, part of Buchenwald, where tens of 
			thousands had perished.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The story goes that when 
			the Americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivors and 
			the piles of dead bodies. And General Eisenhower made a decision. He 
			ordered Germans from the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could 
			see what had been done in their name. And he ordered American troops 
			to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they were fighting 
			against. Then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear 
			witness. And he ordered that photographs and films be made. Some of 
			us have seen those same images, whether in the Holocaust Museum or 
			when I visited Yad Vashem, and they never leave you. Eisenhower said 
			that he wanted &quot;to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of 
			these things, if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to 
			charge these allegations merely to propaganda.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eisenhower understood 
			the danger of silence. He understood that if no one knew what had 
			happened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the 
			perpetrators' ultimate triumph.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What Eisenhower did to 
			record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today. 
			That's what Elie Wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by 
			fighting to make their memories part of our collective memory. 
			That's what the Holocaust Museum does every day on our National 
			Mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and 
			failures and the lessons we've learned from our history. It's the 
			very opposite of silence.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we must also 
			remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation -- 
			it's just the beginning. We know that evil has yet to run its course 
			on Earth. We've seen it in this century in the mass graves and the 
			ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children used as 
			soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war. To this day, there are 
			those who insist the Holocaust never happened; who perpetrate every 
			form of intolerance -- racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia, 
			xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim and 
			diminishes us all.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, and every day, we 
			have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront these 
			scourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see 
			images that disturb us, or wrap ourselves in the false comfort that 
			others' sufferings are not our own. Instead we have the opportunity 
			to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to 
			commit ourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and 
			indifference in whatever forms they may take -- whether confronting 
			those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can to 
			prevent and end atrocities like those that took place in Rwanda, 
			those taking place in Darfur. That is my commitment as President. I 
			hope that is yours, as well.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It will not be easy. At 
			times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection. But in 
			the final analysis, I believe history gives us cause for hope rather 
			than despair -- the hope of a chosen people who have overcome 
			oppression since the days of Exodus; of the nation of Israel rising 
			from the destruction of the Holocaust; of the strong and enduring 
			bonds between our nations.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is the hope, too, of 
			those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the 
			meaning of courage and resilience and dignity. I'm thinking today of 
			a study conducted after the war that found that Holocaust survivors 
			living in America actually had a higher birthrate than American 
			Jews. What a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world 
			that has shown you so much cruelty; to believe that no matter what 
			you have endured, or how much you have lost, in the end, you have a 
			duty to life.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We find cause for hope 
			as well in Protestant and Catholic children attending school 
			together in Northern Ireland; in Hutus and Tutsis living side by 
			side, forgiving neighbors who have done the unforgivable; in a 
			movement to save Darfur that has thousands of high school and 
			college chapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the 
			Washington Mall -- people of every age and faith and background and 
			race united in common cause with suffering brothers and sisters 
			halfway around the world.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those numbers can be our 
			future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to make 
			the journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, 
			and ultimately to reconciliation. That is what we mean when we say 
			&quot;never again.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, during this 
			season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the 
			possibility of redemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do 
			what must be done. And may we strive each day, both individually and 
			as a nation, to be among the righteous.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, God bless 
			you, and God bless the United States of America.</font></div>
