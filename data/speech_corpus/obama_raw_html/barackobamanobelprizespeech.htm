<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your Majesties, Your Royal 
		Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, 
		citizens of America, and citizens of the world:<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility. It's an 
		award that speaks to our highest aspirations -- that for all the cruelty 
		and hardship of our world, we are not mere prisoners of fate. Our 
		actions matter, and can bend history in the direction of justice.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And yet, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable 
		controversy that your generous decision has generated.&nbsp;In part, this is 
		because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the 
		world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who've received 
		this prize -- Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela -- my 
		accomplishments are slight. And then there are the men and women around 
		the world who've been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; 
		those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the 
		unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire 
		even the most hardened cynics. I cannot argue with those who find these 
		men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- 
		to be far more deserving of this honor than I.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize 
		is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation 
		in the midst of two wars.&nbsp;One of these wars is winding down.&nbsp;The other 
		is a conflict that America did not seek, one in which we are joined by 
		42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend 
		ourselves and all nations from further attacks.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Still, we are at war. And I am responsible<sup><font color="#FF0000">1</font></sup> for the deployment of 
		thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land.&nbsp;Some will 
		kill; and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense 
		of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about 
		the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one 
		with the other.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now these questions are not new.&nbsp;War, in one form or another, appeared 
		with the first man.&nbsp;At the dawn of history, its morality was not 
		questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease -- the manner 
		in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their 
		differences.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, 
		so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the 
		destructive power of war. The concept of a &quot;just war&quot; emerged, 
		suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met: 
		if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is 
		proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from 
		violence.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Of course, we know that for most of history, this concept of &quot;just war&quot; 
		was rarely observed.&nbsp;The capacity of human beings to think up new ways 
		to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt 
		from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God.&nbsp;Wars 
		between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which 
		the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred.&nbsp;In the 
		span of 30 years, such carnage would twice engulf this continent.&nbsp;And 
		while it's hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the 
		Third Reich and the Axis powers, World War II was a conflict in which 
		the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers 
		who perished.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In the wake of such destruction, and with the advent of the nuclear age, 
		it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed 
		institutions to prevent another world war.&nbsp;And so a quarter century 
		after the United States Senate rejected the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">
		<font color="#0000FF">League of Nations</font></a> -- an idea 
		for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in 
		constructing an architecture to keep the peace:&nbsp;<a href="../georgecmarshall.html"><font color="#0000FF">a 
		Marshall Plan</font></a>, and a United Nations; mechanisms to govern the 
		waging of war, treaties to protect human rights, prevent genocide, 
		restrict the most dangerous weapons.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In many ways, these efforts succeeded.&nbsp;Yes, terrible wars have been 
		fought, and atrocities committed.&nbsp;But there has been no Third World 
		War.&nbsp;The Cold War ended with 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#The_Fall">
		<font color="#0000FF">jubilant crowds dismantling a wall</font></a>.&nbsp;Commerce has stitched much of the world together.&nbsp;Billions have been 
		lifted from poverty.&nbsp;The ideals of liberty and self-determination, 
		equality, and the rule of law have haltingly advanced.&nbsp;We are the heirs 
		of the fortitude and foresight of generations past, and it is a legacy 
		for which my own country is rightfully proud.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, a decade into a new century, this old architecture is buckling 
		under the weight of new threats. The world may no longer shudder at the 
		prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers, but proliferation may 
		increase the risk of catastrophe.&nbsp;Terrorism has long been a tactic, but 
		modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder 
		innocents on a horrific scale.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Moreover, wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars 
		within nations.&nbsp;The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts; the 
		growth of secessionist movements, insurgencies, and failed states -- all 
		these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos.&nbsp;In 
		today's wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of 
		future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn 
		asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of 
		war.&nbsp;What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the 
		same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted 
		so boldly decades ago.&nbsp;And it will require us to think in new ways 
		about the notions of &quot;just war&quot; and the imperatives of a just peace.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We must begin by acknowledging a hard truth: We will not eradicate 
		violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations, 
		acting individually or in concert, will find the use of force not only 
		necessary but morally justified.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I make this statement mindful of what
		<a href="../mlknobelpeaceprizeacceptance.htm"><font color="#0000FF">
		Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony</font></a> years ago:&nbsp;&quot;Violence never brings permanent peace.&nbsp;It solves no social problem. 
		It merely creates new and more complicated ones.&quot;&nbsp;As someone who stands 
		here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living 
		testimony to the moral force of non-violence.&nbsp;I know there's nothing 
		weak, nothing passive, nothing naïve in the creed and lives of 
		Gandhi and King.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot 
		be guided by their examples alone.&nbsp;I face the world as it is and 
		cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For 
		make no mistake:&nbsp;Evil does exist in the world.&nbsp;A non-violent movement 
		could not have halted Hitler's armies.&nbsp;Negotiations cannot convince al 
		Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms.&nbsp;To say that force may sometimes 
		be necessary is not a call to cynicism. It is a recognition of 
		history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I raise this point, I begin with this point because in many countries 
		there is a deep ambivalence about military action today -- no matter what 
		the cause.&nbsp;And at times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of 
		America, the world's sole military superpower.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, the world must remember that it was not simply international 
		institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought 
		stability to a post-World War II world.&nbsp;Whatever mistakes we have made, 
		the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped 
		underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of 
		our citizens and the strength of our arms.&nbsp; The service and sacrifice of 
		our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from 
		Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the 
		Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our 
		will.&nbsp;We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we 
		seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe 
		that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren 
		can live in freedom and prosperity.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the 
		peace.&nbsp;And yet this truth must coexist with another: that no matter 
		how justified, war promises human tragedy.&nbsp;The soldier's courage and 
		sacrifice is full of glory -- expressing devotion to country, to cause, to 
		comrades in arms. But war itself is never glorious; and we must never 
		trumpet it as such.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly 
		irreconcilable truths: that war is sometimes necessary; and war at 
		some level is an expression of human folly.&nbsp;Concretely, we must direct 
		our effort to the task that
		<a href="../jfkamericanuniversityaddress.html"><font color="#0000FF">
		President Kennedy called for long ago</font></a>.&nbsp;&quot;Let us focus,&quot; he 
		said, &quot;on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden 
		revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human 
		institutions.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A gradual evolution of human institutions.</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What might this evolution look like?</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What might these practical steps 
		be?</font></p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To begin with, I believe that all nations, strong and weak alike, 
		must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.&nbsp;I, like any 
		head of state, reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to 
		defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to 
		standards, international standards, strengthens those who do and 
		isolates and weakens those who don't.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The world rallied around 
		America after the 9/11 attacks and continues to support our efforts in 
		Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the 
		recognized principle of self-defense.&nbsp;Likewise, the world recognized 
		the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a 
		consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Furthermore, America -- in fact, no nation -- can insist that others 
		follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves.&nbsp;For 
		when we don't, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy 
		of future interventions, no matter how justified.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military 
		action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against 
		an aggressor.&nbsp;More and more, we all confront difficult questions about 
		how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to 
		stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire 
		region.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was 
		in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.&nbsp;Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly 
		intervention later.&nbsp;That's why all responsible nations must embrace the 
		role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		America's commitment to global security will never waver. But in a 
		world in which threats are more diffuse and missions more complex 
		America cannot act alone.&nbsp;America alone cannot secure the peace.&nbsp;This 
		is true in Afghanistan.&nbsp;This is true in failed states like Somalia, 
		where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering. And 
		sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to 
		come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and 
		allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they've 
		shown in Afghanistan.&nbsp;But in many countries, there is a disconnect 
		between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the 
		broader public.&nbsp;I understand why war is not popular, but I also know 
		this:&nbsp;The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve 
		it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Peace requires responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Peace entails sacrifice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's 
		why NATO continues to be indispensable.&nbsp;That's why we must strengthen 
		U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few 
		countries.&nbsp;That's why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping 
		and training abroad to Oslo and Rome, to Ottawa and Sydney, to Dhaka and 
		Kigali. We honor them not as makers of war, but as -- of wagers -- but as 
		wagers of peace.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Let me make one final point about the use of force.&nbsp;Even as we make 
		difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about 
		how we fight it.&nbsp;The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding 
		its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red 
		Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in 
		binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct. And even as we confront 
		a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States 
		of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is 
		what makes us different from those whom we fight.&nbsp;That is a source of 
		our strength.&nbsp;That is why I prohibited torture.&nbsp;That is why I ordered 
		the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed 
		America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose 
		ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to 
		defend.&nbsp;And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when 
		it's easy, but when it is hard.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our 
		minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war.&nbsp;But let me now turn to 
		our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we 
		can build a just and lasting peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I 
		believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough 
		enough to actually change behavior. For if we want a lasting peace, 
		then the words of the international community must mean something.&nbsp;Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable.&nbsp;Sanctions 
		must exact a real price.&nbsp; Intransigence must be met with increased 
		pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together 
		as one.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear 
		weapons, and to seek a world without them.&nbsp;In the middle of the last 
		century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear:&nbsp;All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear 
		weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work 
		towards disarmament.&nbsp;I am committed to upholding this treaty.&nbsp;It is a 
		centerpiece of my foreign policy. And I'm working with President 
		Medvedev to reduce America and Russia's nuclear stockpiles.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran 
		and North Korea do not game the system.&nbsp;Those who claim to respect 
		international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted.&nbsp;Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an 
		arms race in the Middle East or East Asia.&nbsp;Those who seek peace cannot 
		stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same principle applies 
		to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own 
		people. When there is <a href="../georgeclooneyunitednations.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">genocide in Darfur</font></a>, systematic rape in 
		Congo, repression in Burma -- there must be consequences.&nbsp;Yes, there 
		will be engagement. Yes, there will be diplomacy. But there must be 
		consequences when those things fail. And the closer we stand together, 
		the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed 
		intervention and complicity in oppression.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		This brings me to a second point: the nature of the peace that we 
		seek. For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict.&nbsp;Only a 
		just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual 
		can truly be lasting.
		It was this insight that drove drafters of the
		<a href="../eleanorrooseveltdeclarationhumanrights.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</font></a> 
		after the Second World War.&nbsp;In the wake of devastation, they recognized 
		that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, too often these words are ignored.&nbsp;For some countries, the 
		failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that 
		these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or 
		stages of a nation's development.&nbsp;And within America, there's long 
		been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or 
		idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow 
		pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around 
		the world.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I reject these choices.&nbsp;I believe that peace is unstable where citizens 
		are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose 
		their own leaders or assemble without fear.&nbsp; Pent-up grievances fester, 
		and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to 
		violence.&nbsp;We also know that the opposite is true.&nbsp;Only when Europe 
		became free did it finally find peace.&nbsp;America has never fought a war 
		against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that 
		protect the rights of their citizens.&nbsp;No matter how callously defined, 
		neither America's interests -- nor the world's -- are served by the 
		denial of human aspirations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different 
		countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are 
		universal.&nbsp;We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi">
		<font color="#0000FF">Aung Sang Suu Kyi</font></a><font color="#0000FF">,</font> to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots 
		in the face of beatings, to the hundreds of thousands who have marched 
		silently through the streets of Iran.&nbsp;It is telling that the leaders of 
		these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the 
		power of any other nation. And it is the responsibility of all free 
		people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these 
		movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Let me also say this:&nbsp;The promotion of human rights cannot be about 
		exhortation alone. At times, it must be coupled with painstaking 
		diplomacy.&nbsp;I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the 
		satisfying purity of indignation.&nbsp;But I also know that sanctions 
		without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward 
		only a crippling status quo.&nbsp;No repressive regime can move down a new 
		path unless it has the choice of an open door.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In light of the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">
		<font color="#0000FF">Cultural Revolution's horrors</font></a>, Nixon's meeting with Mao 
		appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path 
		where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and 
		connected to open societies.&nbsp;Pope John Paul's engagement with Poland 
		created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders 
		like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech_Walesa">
		<font color="#0000FF">Lech Walesa</font></a>.&nbsp;<a href="../ronaldreaganbritishparliament.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Ronald Reagan's efforts on arms control</font></a> 
		and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet 
		Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe.&nbsp;There's no 
		simple formula here.&nbsp; But we must try as best we can to balance 
		isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights 
		and dignity are advanced over time.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Third, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it 
		must encompass economic security and opportunity.&nbsp;For
		<a href="../fdrsoustateoftheunion1944.htm"><font color="#0000FF">true 
		-- true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want</font></a>.
		It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without 
		security; it is also true that security does not exist where human 
		beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the 
		medicine and shelter they need to survive.&nbsp;It does not exist where 
		children can't aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a 
		family.&nbsp;The absence of hope can rot a society from within.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And that's why helping farmers feed their own people, or nations 
		educate their children and care for the sick, is not mere charity.&nbsp;It's also why the world must come together to confront climate change.&nbsp;There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing, we will face 
		more drought, more famine, more mass displacement -- all of which will 
		fuel more conflict for decades.&nbsp;For this reason, it is not merely 
		scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful 
		action. It's military leaders in my own country and others who 
		understand our common security hangs in the balance.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Agreements among nations. Strong institutions.&nbsp;Support for human 
		rights.&nbsp;Investments in development. All these are vital ingredients in 
		bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about. And 
		yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the 
		staying power, to complete this work without something more; and 
		that's the continued expansion of our moral imagination -- an insistence 
		that there's something irreducible that we all share.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human 
		beings to recognize how similar we are -- to understand that we're all 
		basically seeking the same things, that we all hope for the chance to 
		live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for 
		ourselves and our families.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And yet, somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural 
		leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear 
		the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities -- their 
		-- their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion.&nbsp;In some 
		places, this fear has led to conflict.&nbsp;At times, it even feels like 
		we're moving backwards. We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict 
		between Arabs and Jews seems to harden.&nbsp;We see it in nations that are 
		torn asunder by tribal lines.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion is used to 
		justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled 
		the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp;These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of 
		God. The cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded.&nbsp;But they remind 
		us that no Holy War can ever be a just war.&nbsp;For if you truly believe 
		that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for 
		restraint -- no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the 
		Red Cross worker, or even a person of one own's [sic] faith.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Such a warped 
		view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace, but 
		I believe it's incompatible with the very purpose of faith: For the 
		one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do 
		unto others as we would have them do unto us. Adhering to this law of love 
		has always been the core struggle of human nature.&nbsp;For we are 
		fallible. We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of 
		pride, and power, and sometimes evil. Even those of us with the best of 
		intentions will at time[s] fail to right the wrongs before us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we do not have to think 
		that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human 
		condition can be perfected.&nbsp;We do not have to live in an idealized 
		world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place.&nbsp;The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been 
		practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they 
		preached -- their fundamental faith in human progress -- that must 
		always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		For if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or naïve; if we 
		divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- 
		then we lose what's best about humanity.&nbsp;We lose our sense of 
		possibility.&nbsp;We lose our moral compass.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Like generations have before us, we must reject that future.&nbsp;As
		<a href="../mlknobelpeaceprizeacceptance.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Dr. 
		King said at this occasion</font></a> so many years ago, &quot;I refuse to 
		accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history.&nbsp;I 
		refuse to accept the idea that the 'isness' of man's present condition 
		makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal 'oughtness' 
		that forever confronts him.&quot;
		Let us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine 
		that still st[i]rs within each of our souls.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Somewhere today, in the here 
		and now, in the world as it is, a soldier sees he's outgunned, but 
		stands firm to keep the peace.&nbsp;Somewhere today, in this world, a young 
		protestor awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to 
		march on.&nbsp;Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still 
		takes the time to teach her child, scrapes together what few coins she 
		has to send that child to school -- because she believes that a cruel 
		world still has a place for that child's dreams.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us live by their 
		example. We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and 
		still strive for justice.&nbsp;We can admit the intractability of 
		depravation, and still strive for dignity.&nbsp;Clear-eyed, we can 
		understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace.&nbsp;We can 
		do that -- for that is the story of human progress; that's the hope of 
		all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work 
		here on Earth.</font></p>
