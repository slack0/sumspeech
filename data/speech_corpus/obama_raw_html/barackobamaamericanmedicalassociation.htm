		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000">[as 
			prepared for delivery]</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much. Please, everybody, be seated. Thank 
			you very much. You're very kind. Thank you. </font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me begin by thanking 
			Nancy for the wonderful introduction. I want to thank Dr. Joseph 
			Heyman, the chair of the Board of Trustees, as well as Dr. Jeremy 
			Lazarus, speaker of House of Delegates. Thanks to all of you for 
			bringing me home, even if it's just for a day.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From the moment I took 
			office as President, the central challenge we've confronted as a 
			nation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst 
			recession since World War II. In recent months, we've taken a series 
			of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediate damage to 
			our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained 
			growth. We're here to create new jobs, to unfreeze our credit 
			markets. We're stemming the loss of homes and the decline of home 
			values.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All this is important. 
			But even as we've made progress, we know that the road to prosperity 
			remains long and it remains difficult. And we also know that one 
			essential step on our journey is to control the spiraling cost of 
			health care in America. And in order to do that, we're going to need 
			the help of the AMA.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we are spending 
			over $2 trillion a year on health care -- almost 50 percent more per 
			person than the next most costly nation. And yet, as I think many of 
			you are aware, for all of this spending, more of our citizens are 
			uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren't any 
			healthier. In fact, citizens in some countries that spend 
			substantially less than we do are actually living longer than we do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Make no mistake: The 
			cost of our health care is a threat to our economy. It's an 
			escalating burden on our families and businesses. It's a ticking 
			time bomb for the federal budget. And it is unsustainable for the 
			United States of America.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's unsustainable for 
			Americans like Laura Klitzka, a young mother that I met in Wisconsin 
			just last week, who's learned that the breast cancer she thought 
			she'd beaten had spread to her bones, but who's now being forced to 
			spend time worrying about how to cover the $50,000 in medical debts 
			she's already accumulated, worried about future debts that she's 
			going to accumulate, when all she wants to do is spend time with her 
			two children and focus on getting well. These are not the worries 
			that a woman like Laura should have to face in a nation as wealthy 
			as ours.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Stories like Laura's are 
			being told by women and men all across this country -- by families 
			who've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the 
			last decade at a rate three times faster than wages. This is forcing 
			Americans of all ages to go without the checkups or the 
			prescriptions they need -- that you know they need. It's creating a 
			situation where a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our costly health care 
			system is unsustainable for doctors like Michael Kahn in New 
			Hampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day 
			supervising a staff explaining insurance problems to patients, 
			completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters -- a routine 
			that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do 
			what he became a doctor to do and actually care for his patients.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Small business owners 
			like Chris and Becky Link in Nashville are also struggling. They've 
			always wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run 
			marketing firm, but they've recently had to do the unthinkable and 
			lay off a number of employees -- layoffs that could have been 
			deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high. Across the 
			country, over one-third of small businesses have reduced benefits in 
			recent years and one-third have dropped their workers' coverage 
			altogether since the early '90s.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our largest companies 
			are suffering, as well. A big part of what led General Motors and 
			Chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they 
			racked up providing health care for their workers -- costs that made 
			them less profitable and less competitive with automakers around the 
			world. If we do not fix our health care system, America may go the 
			way of GM -- paying more, getting less, and going broke.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When it comes to the 
			cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable. So 
			reform is not a luxury; it is a necessity. When I hear people say, 
			well, why are you taking this on right now, you've got all these 
			other problems, I keep on reminding people I'd love to be able to 
			defer these issues, but we can't. I know there's been much 
			discussion about what reform would cost, and rightly so. This is a 
			test of whether we -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- are serious 
			about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal 
			discipline.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let there be no 
			doubt -- the cost of inaction is greater. If we fail to act -- if we 
			fail to act -- and you know this because you see it in your own 
			individual practices -- if we fail to act, premiums will climb 
			higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will 
			swell to include millions more Americans -- all of which will affect 
			your practice.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we fail to act, one 
			out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care 
			within a decade. And in 30 years, it will be about one out of every 
			three -- a trend that will mean lost jobs, lower take-home pay, 
			shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for all 
			Americans.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And if we fail to act, 
			federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare will grow over the coming 
			decades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government 
			currently spends on our nation's defense. It will, in fact, 
			eventually grow larger than what our government spends on anything 
			else today. It's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state 
			budgets, and impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax 
			hikes, or overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our federal and 
			state budgets.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So to say it as plainly 
			as I can, health care is the single most important thing we can do 
			for America's long-term fiscal health. That is a fact. That's a 
			fact.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a fact, and the 
			truth is most people know that it's a fact. And yet, as clear as it 
			is that our system badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable. 
			There's a sense out there among some, and perhaps some members who 
			are gathered here today of the AMA, that as bad as our current 
			system may be -- and it's pretty bad -- the devil we know is better 
			than the devil we don't. There's a fear of change -- a worry that we 
			may lose what works about our health care system while trying to fix 
			what doesn't.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm here to tell you I 
			understand that fear. And I understand the cynicism. They're scars 
			left over from past efforts at reform. After all, Presidents have 
			called for health care reform for nearly a century. Teddy Roosevelt 
			called for it. Harry Truman called for it. Richard Nixon called for 
			it. Jimmy Carter called for it. Bill Clinton called for it. But 
			while significant individual reforms have been made -- such as 
			Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program -- 
			efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down 
			costs have largely failed.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of the reason is 
			because the different groups involved -- doctors, insurance 
			companies, businesses, workers, and others -- simply couldn't agree 
			on the need for reform or what shape it would take. And if we're 
			honest, another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition 
			fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists -- opposition that has 
			used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an 
			attempt to, yes, socialize medicine.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And despite this long 
			history of failure, I'm standing here because I think we're in a 
			different time. One sign that things are different is that just this 
			past week, the Senate passed a bill that will protect children from 
			the dangers of smoking, a reform the AMA has long championed -- this 
			organization long championed; it went nowhere when it was proposed a 
			decade ago -- I'm going to sign this into law. </font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, what makes this 
			moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- key 
			stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform. 
			They're coming out -- they're coming together out of a recognition 
			that while reform will take everyone in our health care community to 
			do their part -- everybody is going to have to pitch in -- 
			ultimately, everybody will benefit.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want to commend 
			the AMA, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs 
			and achieve reform. Just a week ago, you joined together with 
			hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers and 
			drug companies to do something that would have been unthinkable just 
			a few years ago -- you promised to work together to cut national 
			health care spending by $2 trillion over the next decade, relative 
			to what it would have otherwise been. And that will bring down 
			costs; that will bring down premiums. That's exactly the kind of 
			cooperation we need, and we appreciate that very much. Thank you.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the question is how 
			do we finish the job? How do we permanently bring down costs and 
			make quality, affordable health care available to every single 
			American? That's what I've come to talk about today. We know the 
			moment is right for health care reform. We know this is a historic 
			opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again. But we 
			also know that there are those who will try and scuttle this 
			opportunity no matter what -- who will use the same scare tactics 
			and fear-mongering that's worked in the past; who will give warnings 
			about socialized medicine and government takeovers, long lines and 
			rationed care, decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors. We 
			have heard this all before. And because these fear tactics have 
			worked, things have kept getting worse.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me begin by 
			saying this to you and to the American people: I know that there are 
			millions of Americans who are content with their health care 
			coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value 
			their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means 
			that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise 
			to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to 
			keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll 
			be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it 
			away, no matter what. My view is that health care reform should be 
			guided by a simple principle: Fix what's broken and build on what 
			works. And that's what we intend to do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we do that, we can 
			build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead 
			of administrators and accountants; a system that gives Americans -- 
			a system that gives Americans the best care at the lowest cost; a 
			system that eases up the pressure on businesses and unleashes the 
			promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, 
			making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our 
			economy by tens of billions of dollars more every year. That's how 
			we'll stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, 
			and start investing those dollars in innovations and advances that 
			will make our health care system and our economy stronger.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what we can do 
			with this opportunity. And that's what we must do with this moment.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the good news is 
			that in some instances, there's already widespread agreement on the 
			steps necessary to make our health care system work better.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, we need to 
			upgrade our medical records by switching from a paper to an 
			electronic system of record keeping. And we've already begun to do 
			this with an investment we made as part of our Recovery Act.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It simply doesn't make 
			sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms 
			with pens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere. As Newt 
			Gingrich has rightly pointed out -- and I don't quote Newt Gingrich 
			that often -- we do a better job tracking a FedEx package in this 
			country than we do tracking patients' health records.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You shouldn't have to 
			tell every new doctor you see about your medical history or what 
			prescriptions you're taking. You shouldn't have to repeat costly 
			tests. All that information should be stored securely in a private 
			medical record so that your information can be tracked from one 
			doctor to another -- even if you change jobs, even if you move, even 
			if you have to see a number of different specialists. That's just 
			common sense.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that will not only 
			mean less paper-pushing and lower administrative costs, saving 
			taxpayers billions of dollars; it will also mean all of you 
			physicians will have an easier time doing your jobs. It will tell 
			you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoid 
			prescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction. It 
			will prevent the wrong dosages from going to a patient. It will 
			reduce medical errors, it's estimated, that lead to 100,000 lives 
			lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there shouldn't be an 
			argument there. And we want to make sure that we're helping 
			providers computerize so that we can get this system up and running.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second step that we 
			can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so we can 
			avoid illness and disease in the first place. That starts with each 
			of us taking more responsibility for our health and for the health 
			of our children. It means quitting smoking. It means going in for 
			that mammogram or colon cancer screening. It means going for a run 
			or hitting the gym, and raising our children to step away from the 
			video games and spend more time playing outside.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It also means cutting 
			down on all the junk food that's fueling an epidemic of obesity -- 
			which puts far too many Americans, young and old, at greater risk of 
			costly, chronic conditions. That's a lesson Michelle and I have 
			tried to instill in our daughters. As some of you know, we started a 
			White House vegetable garden. I say &quot;we&quot; generously, because 
			Michelle has done most of the work. That's a lesson that we should 
			work with local school districts to incorporate into their school 
			lunch programs.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Building a health care 
			system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases 
			will require all of us to do our parts. It will take doctors telling 
			us what risk factors we should avoid and what preventive measures we 
			should pursue. It will take employers following the example of 
			places like Safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care 
			of their health while reducing health care costs in the process.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you're one of 
			three-quarters of Safeway workers enrolled in their &quot;Healthy 
			Measures&quot; program, you can get screened for problems like high 
			cholesterol or high blood pressure. And if you score well, you can 
			pay lower premiums; you get more money in your paycheck. It's a 
			program that has helped Safeway cut health care spending by 13 
			percent, and workers save over 20 percent on their premiums. And 
			we're open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs 
			like this one.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our federal government 
			also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy 
			living. Five of the costliest illnesses and conditions -- cancer, 
			cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, and strokes -- can 
			be prevented. And yet only a fraction of every health care dollar 
			goes to prevention or public health. And that's starting to change 
			with an investment we're making in prevention and wellness programs 
			that can help us avoid disease that harm our health and the health 
			of our economy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as important as they 
			are, investments in electronic records and preventive care, all the 
			things that I've just mentioned, they're just preliminary steps. 
			They will only make a dent in the epidemic of rising costs in this 
			country.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Despite what some have 
			suggested, the reason we have these spiraling costs is not simply 
			because we've got an aging population; demographics do account for 
			part of rising costs because older, sicker societies pay more on 
			health care than younger, healthier ones, and there's nothing 
			intrinsically wrong in us taking better care of ourselves. But what 
			accounts for the bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care 
			delivery system itself -- a system where we spend vast amounts of 
			money on things that aren't necessarily making our people any 
			healthier; a system that automatically equates more expensive care 
			with better care.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, a recent article in 
			the New Yorker, for example, showed how McAllen, Texas, is spending 
			twice as much as El Paso County -- twice as much -- not because 
			people in McAllen, Texas, are sicker than they are in El Paso; not 
			because they're getting better care or getting better outcomes. It's 
			simply because they're using more treatments -- treatments that, in 
			some cases, they don't really need; treatments that, in some cases, 
			can actually do people harm by raising the risk of infection or 
			medical error.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the problem is this 
			pattern is repeating itself across America. One Dartmouth study 
			shows that you're less likely -- you're no less likely to die from a 
			heart attack and other ailments in a higher-spending area than in a 
			lower-spending one.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two main 
			reasons for this. The first is a system of incentives where the more 
			tests and services are provided, the more money we pay. And a lot of 
			people in this room know what I'm talking about. It's a model that 
			rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care; that 
			pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you 
			can't spend much time with each, and gives you every incentive to 
			order that extra MRI or EKG, even if it's not necessary. It's a 
			model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- a 
			calling -- to a business.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's not why you 
			became doctors. That's not why you put in all those hours in the 
			Anatomy Suite or the O.R. That's not what brings you back to a 
			patient's bedside to check in, or makes you call a loved one of a 
			patient to say it will be fine. You didn't enter this profession to 
			be bean-counters and paper-pushers. You entered this profession to 
			be healers. And that's what our health care system should let you 
			be. That's what this health care system should let you be. </font>
		</div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that starts with 
			reforming the way we compensate our providers -- doctors and 
			hospitals. We need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every 
			single treatment you offer a patient with a chronic condition like 
			diabetes, but instead paid well for how you treat the overall 
			disease. We need to create incentives for physicians to team up, 
			because we know that when that happens, it results in a healthier 
			patient. We need to give doctors bonuses for good health outcomes, 
			so we're not promoting just more treatment, but better care.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we need to rethink 
			the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medical 
			students who choose a career as a primary care physician -- who 
			choose to work in underserved areas instead of the more lucrative 
			paths. That's why we're making a substantial investment in the 
			National Health Service Corps that will make medical training more 
			affordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they 
			aren't drowning in debt when they enter the workforce. Somebody back 
			there is drowning in debt.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second structural 
			reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical 
			information making its way to doctors and patients. We have the best 
			medical schools, the most sophisticated labs, the most advanced 
			training of any nation on the globe. Yet we're not doing a very good 
			job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of 
			better medicine.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Less than 1 percent of 
			our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most 
			effective -- less than 1 percent. And even when that information 
			finds its way into journals, it can take up to 17 years to find its 
			way to an exam room or operating table. As a result, too many 
			doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the 
			latest research.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A recent study, for 
			example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based on 
			scientific evidence -- half. That means doctors may be doing a 
			bypass operation when placing a stent is equally effective; or 
			placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drug and medical 
			management is equally effective -- all of which drives up costs 
			without improving a patient's health.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So one thing we need to 
			do is to figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementation 
			of what works into your practices. That's why we're making a major 
			investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety 
			of ailments and conditions.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me be clear -- 
			I just want to clear something up here -- identifying what works is 
			not about dictating what kind of care should be provided. It's about 
			providing patients and doctors with the information they need to 
			make the best medical decisions. See, I have the assumption that if 
			you have good information about what makes your patients well, 
			that's what you're going to do. I have confidence in that. We're not 
			going to need to force you to do it. We just need to make sure 
			you've got the best information available.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still, even when we do 
			know what works, we are often not making the most of it. And that's 
			why we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at 
			places like the Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where the quality of 
			care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after the hospital began 
			incorporating suggestions from parents. And places like Tallahassee 
			Memorial Health Care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with 
			rapid response teams that monitored patients' conditions, and 
			&quot;multidisciplinary rounds&quot; with everyone from physicians to 
			pharmacists. And places like Geisinger Health System in rural 
			Pennsylvania, and Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, where 
			high-quality care is being provided at a cost well below the 
			national average. These are all islands of excellence that we need 
			to make the standard in our health care system.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So replicating best 
			practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities -- any 
			legislation sent to my desk that does not these -- does not achieve 
			these goals in my mind does not earn the title of reform.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But my signature on a 
			bill is not enough. I need your help, doctors, because to most 
			Americans you are the health care system. The fact is Americans -- 
			and I include myself and Michelle and our kids in this -- we just do 
			what you tell us to do. That's what we do. We listen to you, we 
			trust you. And that's why I will listen to you and work with you to 
			pursue reform that works for you. </font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together, if we take all 
			these steps, I am convinced we can bring spending down, bring 
			quality up; we can save hundreds of billions of dollars on health 
			care costs while making our health care system work better for 
			patients and doctors alike. And when we align the interests of 
			patients and doctors, then we're going to be in a good place.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I recognize that it 
			will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like 
			they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of 
			lawsuits. I recognize that. Don't get too excited yet. Now, I 
			understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and 
			treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable. That's a real issue. 
			Now, just hold on to your horses here, guys. I want to be honest 
			with you. I'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards -- which I 
			personally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully 
			harmed.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I do think we need 
			to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first; 
			how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine; how to encourage 
			broader use of evidence-based guidelines. I want to work with the 
			AMA so we can scale back the excessive defensive medicine that 
			reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we are 
			providing better care, simply -- rather than simply more treatment.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is going to be a 
			priority for me. And I know, based on your responses, it's a 
			priority for you. And I look forward to working with you. And it's 
			going to be difficult. But all this stuff is going to be difficult. 
			All of it's going to be important.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know this has 
			been a long speech, but we got more to do. The changes that I have 
			already spoken about, all that is going to need to go hand-in-hand 
			with other reforms. Because our health care system is so complex and 
			medicine is always evolving, we need a way to continually evaluate 
			how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I'm open to 
			expanding the role of a commission created by a Republican Congress 
			called the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which happens to 
			include a number of physicians on the commission. In recent years, 
			this commission proposed roughly $200 billion in savings that never 
			made it into law. These recommendations have now been incorporated 
			into our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their 
			proposals, the commission's proposals, in the future so that we 
			don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars, as we 
			gain more information about what works and what doesn't work in our 
			health care system.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as we seek to 
			contain the cost of health care, we also have to ensure that every 
			American can get coverage they can afford. We must do so in part 
			because it's in all of our economic interests. Each time an 
			uninsured American steps foot into an emergency room with no way to 
			reimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every 
			American family as a bill of about $1,000 that's reflected in higher 
			taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs. It's a hidden 
			tax, a hidden bill that will be cut as we insure all Americans. And 
			as we insure every young and healthy American, it will spread out 
			risk for insurance companies, further reducing costs for everyone.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But alongside these 
			economic arguments, there's another, more powerful one. And it is 
			simply this: We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million 
			uninsured men, women and children. We are not a nation that lets 
			hardworking families go without coverage, or turns its back on those 
			in need. We're a nation that cares for its citizens. We look out for 
			one another. That's what makes us the United States of America. We 
			need to get this done.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">So we need to do a few 
			things to provide affordable health insurance to every single 
			American. The first thing we need to do is to protect what's working 
			in our health care system. So just in case you didn't catch it the 
			first time, let me repeat: If you like your health care system and 
			your doctor, the only thing reform will mean to you is your health 
			care will cost less. If anyone says otherwise, they are either 
			trying to mislead you or don't have their facts straight.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, if you don't like 
			your health care coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, 
			you'll have a chance, under what we've proposed, to take part in 
			what we're calling a Health Insurance Exchange. This exchange will 
			allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits 
			and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family -- 
			the same way, by the way, that federal employees can do, from a 
			postal worker to a member of Congress. You will have your choice of 
			a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every 
			plan would offer an affordable, basic package.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, this is for 
			people who aren't happy with their current plan. If you like what 
			you're getting, keep it. Nobody is forcing you to shift. But if 
			you're not, this gives you some new options. And I believe one of 
			these options needs to be a public option that will give people a 
			broader range of choices -- and inject competition into the health 
			care market so that force -- so that we can force waste out of the 
			system and keep the insurance companies honest.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that there's 
			some concern about a public option. Even within this organization 
			there's healthy debate about it. In particular, I understand that 
			you're concerned that today's Medicare rates, which many of you 
			already feel are too low, will be applied broadly in a way that 
			means our cost savings are coming off your backs.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And these are legitimate 
			concerns, but they're ones, I believe, that can be overcome. As I 
			stated earlier, the reforms we propose to reimbursement are to 
			reward best practices, focus on patient care, not on the current 
			piecework reimbursements. What we seek is more stability and a 
			health care system that's on a sounder financial footing.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the fact is these 
			reforms need to take place regardless of whether there's a public 
			option or not. With reform, we will ensure that you are being 
			reimbursed in a thoughtful way that's tied to patient outcomes, 
			instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the Sustainable 
			Growth Rate formula that's based on politics and the immediate state 
			of the federal budget in any given year.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I just want to point 
			out the alternative to such reform is a world where health care 
			costs grow at an unsustainable rate. And if you don't think that's 
			going to threaten your reimbursements and the stability of our 
			health care system, you haven't been paying attention.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the public option is 
			not your enemy; it is your friend, I believe.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me also say that -- 
			let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward 
			by those who are claiming that a public option is somehow a Trojan 
			horse for a single-payer system. I'll be honest; there are countries 
			where a single-payer system works pretty well. But I believe -- and 
			I've taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief -- 
			that it's important for our reform efforts to build on our 
			traditions here in the United States. So when you hear the naysayers 
			claim that I'm trying to bring about government-run health care, 
			know this: They're not telling the truth.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What I am trying to do 
			-- and what a public option will help do -- is put affordable health 
			care within reach for millions of Americans. And to help ensure that 
			everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our 
			exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it. 
			That way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain 
			uninsured.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, it's because I'm 
			confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance 
			at an affordable rate that I'm open to a system where every American 
			bears responsibility for owning health insurance -- so long as we 
			provide a hardship waiver for those who still can't afford it as we 
			move towards this system.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same is true for 
			employers. While I believe every business has a responsibility to 
			provide health insurance for its workers, small businesses that 
			can't afford it should receive an exemption. And small business 
			workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in the 
			exchange if their employer is not able to provide it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, here's some good 
			news. Insurance companies have expressed support for the idea of 
			covering the uninsured and they certainly are in favor of a mandate. 
			I welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform 
			debate. I'm glad they're at the table. But what I refuse to do is 
			simply create a system where insurance companies suddenly have a 
			whole bunch of more customers on Uncle Sam's dime, but still fail to 
			meet their responsibilities. We're not going to do that.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me give you an 
			example of what I'm talking about. We need to end the practice of 
			denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. The days of 
			cherry-picking who to cover and who to deny, those days are over. I 
			know you see it in your practices, and how incredibly painful and 
			frustrating it is -- you want to give somebody care and you find out 
			that the insurance companies are wiggling out of paying.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is personal for me 
			also. I've told this story before. I'll never forget watching my own 
			mother, as she fought cancer in her final days, spending time 
			worrying about whether her insurer would claim her illness was a 
			preexisting condition so it could get out of providing coverage. 
			Changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least 
			we can do -- for my mother and for every other mother, father, son, 
			and daughter, who has suffered under this practice, who've been 
			paying premiums and don't get care. We need to put health care 
			within the reach for millions of Americans.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even if we accept 
			all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordable 
			coverage to all Americans, there is no denying that expanding 
			coverage will come at a cost, at least in the short run. But it is a 
			cost that will not -- I repeat -- will not add to our deficits. I've 
			set down a rule for my staff, for my team -- and I've said this to 
			Congress -- health care reform must be, and will be, deficit-neutral 
			in the next decade.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there are already 
			voices saying the numbers don't add up. They're wrong. Here's why. 
			Making health care affordable for all Americans will cost somewhere 
			on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That's real 
			money, even in Washington. But remember, that's less than we are 
			projected to have spent on the war in Iraq. And also remember, 
			failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely 
			reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost 
			economic growth and lower wages.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, let me 
			explain how we will cover the price tag. First, as part of the 
			budget that was passed a few months ago, we put aside $635 billion 
			over 10 years in what we're calling a Health Reserve Fund. Over half 
			of that amount -- more than $300 billion -- will come from raising 
			revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions 
			the wealthiest Americans can take to the same level that it was at 
			the end of the Reagan years -- same level that it was under Ronald 
			Reagan. Some are concerned that this will dramatically reduce 
			charitable giving, for example, but statistics show that's not true. 
			And the best thing for our charities is the stronger economy that we 
			will build with health care reform.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we can't just raise 
			revenues. We're also going to have to make spending cuts, in part by 
			examining inefficiencies in our current Medicare program. There are 
			going to be robust debates about where these cuts should be made, 
			and I welcome that debate. But here's where I think these cuts 
			should be made.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, we should end 
			overpayments to Medicare Advantage. Today, we're paying Medicare 
			Advantage plans much more than we pay for traditional Medicare 
			services. Now, this is a good deal for insurance companies. It's a 
			subsidy to insurance companies. It's not a good deal for you. It's 
			not a good deal for the American people. And by the way, it doesn't 
			follow free market principles, for those who are always talking 
			about free market principles. That's why we need to introduce 
			competitive bidding into the Medicare Advantage program, a program 
			under which private insurance companies are offering Medicare 
			coverage. That alone will save $177 billion over the next decade, 
			just that one step.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, we need to use 
			Medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospital readmissions. 
			Right now, almost 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged from 
			hospitals are readmitted within a month, often because they're not 
			getting the comprehensive care that they need. This puts people at 
			risk; it drives up cost. By changing how Medicare reimburses 
			hospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts 
			profits but drives up costs for everyone else. That will save us $25 
			billion over the next decade.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, we need to 
			introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace.These are 
			drugs used to treat illnesses like anemia. But right now, there is 
			no pathway at the FDA for approving generic versions of these drugs. 
			Creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars. We can 
			save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our 
			poorer seniors while asking our well-off seniors to pay a little 
			more for their drugs.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that's the bulk of 
			what's in the Health Reserve Fund. I've also proposed saving another 
			$313 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending in several other 
			ways. One way is by adjusting Medicare payments to reflect new 
			advances and productivity gains in our economy. Right now, Medicare 
			payments are rising each year by more than they should. These 
			adjustments will create incentives for providers to deliver care 
			more efficiently, and save us roughly $109 billion in the process.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another way we can 
			achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treating 
			uninsured people. I know hospitals rely on these payments now, 
			legitimately, because of the large number of uninsured patients that 
			they treat. But if we put in a system where people have coverage and 
			the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the 
			amount we pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as 
			well. Reducing these payments gradually, as more and more people 
			have coverage, will save us over $106 billion. And we'll make sure 
			the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can also save about 
			$75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs. 
			And we can save about $1 billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, 
			fraud throughout our health care system so that no one is charging 
			more for a service than it's worth or charging a dime for a service 
			that they don't provide.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me be clear: I'm 
			committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior 
			citizens. In fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of 
			the Medicare Trust Fund by seven years, and reduce premiums for 
			Medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over the next 10 
			years. And I'm working with AARP to uphold that commitment.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for those of you 
			who took out your pencil and paper -- altogether, these savings mean 
			that we've put about $950 billion on the table -- and that doesn't 
			count some of the long-term savings that we think will come about 
			from reform -- from medical IT, for example, or increased investment 
			in prevention. So that stuff in congressional jargon is not 
			scorable; the Congressional Budget Office won't count that as 
			savings, so we're setting that aside. We think that's going to come, 
			but even separate and far from that, we've put $950 billion on the 
			table, taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of 
			health care reform.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the weeks and months 
			ahead, I look forward to working with Congress to make up the 
			difference so that health care reform is fully paid for -- in a 
			real, accountable way. And let me add that this does not count 
			longer-term savings. I just want to repeat that. By insisting that 
			the reforms that we're introducing are deficit-neutral over the next 
			decade, and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth 
			rate of health care costs over the coming decades -- bending the 
			curve -- we can look forward to faster economic growth, higher 
			living standards, and falling, instead of rising, budget deficits.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me just wrap up 
			by saying this. I know people are cynical whether we can do this or 
			not. I know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the 
			days ahead. There's probably healthy debate within the AMA. That's 
			good. I also know this: We can't let this moment pass us by.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, the other day, 
			a friend of mine, Congressman Earl Blumenauer, handed me a magazine 
			with a special issue titled, &quot;The Crisis in American Medicine.&quot; One 
			article notes &quot;soaring charges.&quot; Another warns about the &quot;volume of 
			utilization of services.&quot; Another asks if we can find a &quot;better way 
			than fee-for-service for paying for medical care.&quot; It speaks to many 
			of the challenges we face today. The thing is, this special issue 
			was published by Harper's Magazine in October of 1960 -- before I 
			was born.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Members of the American 
			Medical Association, and my fellow Americans, I'm here today because 
			I don't want our children and their children to still be speaking of

		<div class="legacy-para">

			parents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are 
			exercising more; where patients are spending more time with their 
			doctors, and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medical 
			information and latest research they'll ever want to know to meet 
			patients' needs; where orthopedists and nephrologists and 
			oncologists are all working together to treat a single human being;
