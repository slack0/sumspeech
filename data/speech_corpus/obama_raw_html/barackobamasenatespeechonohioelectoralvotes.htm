		<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana"><u>Senator Obama</u>: Thank you very much, Mr. President; Ladies and 
Gentlemen of the Senate:</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">I have to say that I didn't anticipate speaking today, 
but the importance, I think, of this issue is one in which I feel it's important 
for me to address this body. <br>
<br>
You know, during the election I had the occasion of meeting a woman who had supported me 
in my campaign. And she decided to come to shake my hand and take a photograph. 
A wonderful woman, she wasn't asking for anything, and I was very grateful that 
she took time to come by. It was a[n] unexceptional moment except for the fact 
that she was born in 1894. And her name was Marguerite Lewis, an African-American 
woman who had been born in Louisiana, born in the shadow of slavery, born at a 
time when lynchings were commonplace, born at a time when African-Americans and 
women could not vote.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, over the course of decades she had participated 
in broadening our democracy and ensuring that, in fact, at some point, if not 
herself, then her children and her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren would 
be in a position in which they could, too, call themselves citizens of the 
United States and make certain that this Government works not just on behalf of 
the mighty and the powerful but also on behalf of people like her.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And so the fact that she voted and that her vote was counted 
in this election was of supreme importance to her and it is the memory of 
talking to her and shaking her hand that causes me to rise on this occasion.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am absolutely convinced that the President of the 
United States, George Bush, 
<a href="../convention2004/georgewbush2004victoryspeech.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">won this election</font></a>. I also believe that he got more votes 
in Ohio. I think, as has already been said by some of the speakers in this body, 
he is not some -- this is 
not an issue in which we are challenging the outcome of the election. And I 
think it's 
important for us to separate out the issue of the election outcome with the election 
process.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I was not in this body four years ago, but what I 
observed as a voter, as a citizen of Illinois four years ago, were 
<a href="../bushvgoreusscoralarguments.htm"><font color="#0000FF">troubling 
evidence of the fact that not every vote was being counted</font></a>. And I think that it is unfortunate 
four years later that we continue to see circumstances in which people who believe 
that they have the right to vote -- who show up at the polls -- still continue to 
confront the sort of problems that have been documented as taking place, not just 
in Ohio, but [in] places all across the country.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would strongly urge that this Chamber, as well as the 
House of Representatives, take it upon itself once and for all to reform this 
system. There is no reason, at a time when we have enormous battles taking place 
ideologically all across the globe, at a time when we're try to make certain 
that we 
encourage democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places throughout the 
world, that we have the legitimacy of our elections challenged, rightly or 
wrongly, by people who are not certain as to whether our processes are fair 
and just. This is something that we can fix. We have experts on 
both sides of the aisle who know how to fix it. What we've lacked is the 
political will.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would strongly urge that, in a circumstance in which too 
many voters have stood in long lines for hours, in which too many voters have 
cast votes on machines that jam or malfunction or suck the votes without a 
trace, in which too many voters try to register to vote only to discover that 
their names don't appear on the roles, or that partisan political interests and 
those that serve them have worked hard to throw up every barrier to recognize 
them as lawful, in which too many voters will know that there are different 
elections for different parts of the country and that these differences turn 
shamefully on differences of wealth or of race, in which too many voters have to 
contend with state officials, servants of the public, who put partisan or 
personal political interests ahead of the public in administering our elections 
-- in such circumstances, we have an obligation to fix the problem.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And I have to add that this is not a problem unique to this 
election, and it is not a partisan problem. Keep in mind, I come from Cook 
County, from Chicago, in which there is a long record of these kinds of problems 
taking place and disadvantaging Republicans as well as Democrats. So I would ask that 
all of us rise up and use this occasion -- </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Senate President</u>: Senator's time has expired.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana"><u>Senator Obama</u>: -- to amend this problem. 
Thank you.</font></p>
