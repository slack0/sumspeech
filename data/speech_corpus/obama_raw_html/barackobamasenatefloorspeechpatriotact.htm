<font size="1" color="#CE0A04" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">You know, four years ago, following the most 
<a href="../../rhetoricofterrorism.htm"><font color="#0000FF">devastating attack in our history</font></a>, this 
Body passed the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act"><font color="#0000FF">USA PATRIOT Act</font></a> in 
order to give our Nation's law enforcement the tools they needed to track down 
terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world; 
terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our 
security to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took 
place on September 11th.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to 
go undetected in this country. And we all agree that we needed to make it harder 
for them to organize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our 
borders. Americans everywhere wanted to do that.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">But soon after the PATRIOT Act passed, a few years before I even arrived 
here in the 
Senate, I began hearing concerns from people of every background and political 
leaning that this law, the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also 
threatening to violate some of the rights and freedoms that we hold most dear; that 
it didn't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe 
but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, in Washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or 
debate: Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most 
cherished principles. I would suggest, Mr. President, that this is a false choice. It asks too little of us 
and it assumes too little about America.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">That's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act, we've 
been working in a bipartisan way to do both -- to show American people that we can 
track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties, to show the 
American people that the Federal Government will only issue warrants and execute 
searches because it needs to do so, not because it can do so.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">What we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group 
of Senators is some accountability in this process to get answers and see 
evidence where there is suspicion.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit. The Judiciary Committee and the 
U.S. -- U.S. Senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while I can't 
say is perfect, was able to address some of the most serious problems in the 
existing law.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed 
aside in conference. Instead, we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed 
legislation that fails to address the concerns of Members of both parties as 
well as the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">This is legislation that puts our own Justice Department above the law. When 
national security letters are issued, they allow Federal agents to conduct any 
search on any American, no matter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever 
going before a judge to prove that the search is necessary. All that is needed is a 
signoff from a local FBI agent. That's it.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Once a business or a person receives notification 
that they will be searched, they 
are prohibited from telling anyone about it and they're even prohibited from 
challenging this automatic gag order in court. Even though judges have already 
found that similar restrictions violate the first amendment, this conference 
report disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">If you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on. 
You will have 
to tell the FBI that you've done so. Think about that: You want to talk to a lawyer 
about whether or not your actions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've 
got to tell the FBI that you're consulting a lawyer. This is unheard of. There 
is no such requirement in any other area of the law. I see no reason why it's 
justified here.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">And if someone wants to know why their own Government has decided to go on a fishing 
expedition through every personal record or private document, through the 
library books that you read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've 
sent, this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a 
search in a court of law. No judge will hear your plea; no jury will hear your 
case. This is just plain wrong. And there are Republican Senators as well as Democratic 
Senators that recognize that it's plain 
wrong.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities 
is one thing and it's the right thing; but doing it without any real oversight 
seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands 
for.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should 
just hold our noses and 
support this legislation because it's not going to get any better. That is not 
a good argument. We can do better. We've got time to do better. It doesn't 
convince me that I should support this report. I believe we owe it to the Nation, we owe it to 
those who fought for our civil liberties, we owe it to the future and our 
children to make sure that we craft the kind of legislation that would make us proud, 
not just legislation that we would settle 
for because we're in a rush. We don't have to settle for a PATRIOT Act that 
sacrifices our liberties or our safety. We can have one that secures both.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of 
Congress to extend the PATRIOT Act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on 
this bill that is well thought through. I support these efforts and will oppose 
cloture on what I consider to be this unacceptable conference report.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor....</font></p>
