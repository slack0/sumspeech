&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning, 
			everybody.&nbsp; Before I introduce America's next Surgeon General, I'd 
			like to say a few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the 
			health care system that she will help oversee.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are now closer to the 
			goal of health care reform than we have ever been.&nbsp; Over the last 
			several weeks, key committees in the House and the Senate have made 
			important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower 
			costs, provide better care for patients, and curb the worst 
			practices of the insurance companies.&nbsp; It's a plan that will not add 
			to our deficit over the next decade.&nbsp; Let me repeat that:&nbsp; It is a 
			plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade -- and 
			eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing 
			cost of Medicare and Medicaid.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even though we are 
			close, I've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over 
			the finish line.&nbsp; There are going to be more debates and more 
			disagreements before all is said and done.&nbsp; But health care reform 
			must be done.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are those 
			who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a more 
			incremental approach, or simply do nothing.&nbsp; But this is the kind of 
			criticism we heard when the country tried to pass Medicare, a 
			program that is now providing quality care to generations of 
			American seniors.&nbsp; It's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried 
			to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has provided 
			quality care and coverage to millions of kids.&nbsp; It's the same 
			Washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off 
			tough decisions for decades.&nbsp; And it is precisely that kind of small 
			thinking that has led us into the current predicament.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So make no mistake:&nbsp; The 
			status quo on health care is no longer an option for the United 
			States of America.&nbsp; If we step back from this challenge right now, 
			we will leave our children a legacy of debt -- a future of crushing 
			costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, and because we 
			will have done nothing to bring down the cost of Medicare and 
			Medicaid, will crush our government.&nbsp; Premiums will continue to 
			skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another tax on American 
			families struggling to pay bills.&nbsp; The insurance companies and 
			special interests that have killed reform in the past will only 
			continue to benefit even more -- and they'll continue to deny 
			coverage to Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.&nbsp; People 
			will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose their 
			job or they change jobs.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a future that we 
			cannot afford.&nbsp; This country can't afford to have health care 
			premiums rise three times faster than people's wages, as they did 
			over the last decade.&nbsp; We can't afford 14,000 Americans losing their 
			health care every single day.&nbsp; We can't afford a future where our 
			government will eventually spend more on Medicare and Medicaid than 
			what we spend on everything else.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And during the campaign, 
			I promised health care reform that would control costs, expand 
			coverage, and ensure choice.&nbsp; And I promised that Americans making 
			$250,000 a year or less would not pay more in taxes.&nbsp; These are 
			promises that we're keeping as reform moves forward.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is no longer a 
			problem we can wait to fix.&nbsp; This is about who we are as a country.&nbsp; 
			Health care reform is about every family's health, but it's also 
			about the health of the economy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I just want to put 
			everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the 
			week that I was gone:&nbsp; We are going to get this done.&nbsp; Inaction is 
			not an option.&nbsp; And for those nay-sayers and cynics who think that 
			this is not going to happen, don't bet against us.&nbsp; We are going to 
			make this thing happen, because the American people desperately need 
			it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And even those who are 
			satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that if 
			premiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health 
			insurance because it's unsustainable and if you look at the 
			trajectory of where Medicare and Medicaid are going, then inaction 
			will create the biggest crisis of all.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so I understand 
			people are a little nervous and a little scared about making 
			change.&nbsp; The muscles in this town to bring about big changes are a 
			little atrophied, but we're whipping folks back into shape.&nbsp; We are 
			going to get this done.&nbsp; And if there's anyone who understands the 
			urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, 
			it's the woman who will become our nation's next Surgeon General, 
			Dr. Regina Benjamin.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The list of 
			qualifications that make Dr. Benjamin an outstanding candidate to be 
			America's leading spokesperson on issues of public health are long 
			indeed.&nbsp; She was in the second class at Morehouse School of Medicine 
			and went on to earn an MD from the University of Alabama at 
			Birmingham and an MBA from Tulane.&nbsp; She served as Associate Dean for 
			Rural Health at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine, 
			and in 1995, she became the first physician under 40 and the first 
			African American woman to be named to the American Medical 
			Association's Board of Trustees.&nbsp; In 2002, she became President of 
			Alabama's State Medical Association.&nbsp; And she has received numerous 
			awards and recognitions, including the MacArthur Genius Award.&nbsp; It's 
			very impressive.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But of all these 
			achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today's 
			challenges or closer to Regina's heart than the rural health clinic 
			that she has built and rebuilt in Bayou La Batre -- did I say that 
			right?&nbsp; Well, tell me how to say it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>
			<font color="#CE0A04">Dr. Benjamin:</font></b>&nbsp; Bayou La Batre.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
			<font color="#000048">President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Bayou La Batre.&nbsp; That's in Alabama, people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bayou La Batre is a 
			rural town of about 2,500 people.&nbsp; It's a shrimping town, where a 
			lot of folks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually 
			afford health insurance.&nbsp; And by the way, Dr. Benjamin, while we 
			were talking in the Oval Office, described for me the demographics 
			of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got 
			whites, blacks, and Asians in this community.&nbsp; There are a lot of 
			Laotians and Cambodians who have moved there and are part of this 
			shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community.&nbsp; 
			And like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are 
			hard to come by.&nbsp; And that's why, even though she could have left 
			the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a 
			wealthier community, Regina Benjamin returned to Alabama and opened 
			a small clinic in Bayou La Batre.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When people couldn't 
			pay, she didn't charge them.&nbsp; When the clinic wasn't making money, 
			she didn't take a salary for herself. When Hurricane George 
			destroyed the clinic in 1998, she made house calls to all her 
			patients while it was rebuilt.&nbsp; When Hurricane Katrina destroyed it 
			again and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house 
			and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second 
			time.&nbsp; She tended to those who had been wounded in the storm, and 
			when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the 
			bill her way.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And when Regina's clinic 
			was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to the 
			ground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess 
			what Dr. Benjamin did.&nbsp; With help from her community, she is 
			rebuilding it again.&nbsp; One disabled patient brought her an envelope 
			with $20 inside.&nbsp; Another elderly man said simply, &quot;Maybe I can 
			help.&nbsp; I got a hammer.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For nearly two decades, 
			Dr. Regina Benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken 
			about our health care system.&nbsp; She's seen an increasing number of 
			patients who've had health insurance their entire lives suddenly 
			lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become 
			too expensive.&nbsp; She's been a relentless promoter of prevention and 
			wellness programs, having treated too many costly and -- diseases 
			and complications that didn't have to happen.&nbsp; And she's witnessed 
			the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved 
			areas where she works.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But for all that she's 
			seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, Regina 
			Benjamin also represents what's best about health care in America -- 
			doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of 
			their patients; those Americans who would do anything to heal a 
			fellow citizen.&nbsp; Through floods and fires and severe want, Regina 
			Benjamin has refused to give up.&nbsp; Her patients have refused to give 
			up.&nbsp; And when we were talking in the Oval Office, she said:&nbsp; The one 
			thing I want to do is make sure that this Surgeon General's Office 
			gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; 
			somebody is advocating for them and speaking for them.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now we in Washington 
			and across America have to refuse to give up on the goal of health 
			care that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us.&nbsp; We 
			don't have to deal with hurricanes and we don't have to deal with 
			floods and we don't have to deal with fires; all we have to do is 
			pass a bill to make sure that the American people have a decent shot 
			at getting the kind of choice and high-quality health care that's 
			affordable.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I know that Dr. 
			Benjamin is going to help us get there as the next Surgeon General.&nbsp; 
			And I am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and Secretary 
			Sebelius is equally excited, even though she's just standing here.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With that, let me
