		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity 
		-- we 
		really appreciate it.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Thank you so much.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Sir, you just met with your personal envoy to the Middle East, 
		Senator Mitchell. Obviously, his first -- first task is to consolidate the 
		cease-fire. But beyond that you've been saying that you want to pursue 
		actively and aggressively peacemaking between the Palestinians and...the 
		Israelis. Tell us a little bit about how do you see your personal role, 
		because, you know, if the President of the United States is not 
		involved, nothing happens -- as the history of peace making shows. Will 
		you be proposing ideas, pitching proposals, parameters, as one of your 
		predecessors did? Or just urging the parties to come up with their own 
		resolutions, as -- as your immediate predecessor did?<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Well, I -- I think the 
		-- the most important thing is for the United 
		States to get engaged right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:
		</font></b>Right.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: </font></b> And George Mitchell is somebody of 
		enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international 
		experience brokering peace deals.<br>
		<br>
		And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the
		United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues 
		-- and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So, let's 
		listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved and 
		he will then report back to me. From there, we will formulate a specific 
		response.<br>
		<br>
		Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians 
		what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But 
		I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the 
		path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity 
		and security for their people, and that, instead, it's time to return to 
		the negotiating table.<br>
		<br>
		It's going to be difficult; it's going to take time. I don't want to 
		prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations 
		are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a 
		few months. But if we start steady progress on these issues, I'm 
		absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with 
		the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region 
		-- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> You've been saying essentially that we should not look at these 
		issues -- like the Palestinian-Israeli track and separation from the 
		border region -- you've been talking about a kind of holistic approach 
		to the region. Are we expecting a different paradigm in the sense that 
		in the past one of the critiques -- at least from the Arab side, the 
		Muslim side -- is that everything the Americans always test -- tested with the 
		Israelis, if it works. Now there is an Arab peace plan, there is a 
		regional aspect to it. And -- And you've indicated that. Would there be any 
		shift, a paradigm shift?<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Well -- Well, here's what I think is important. 
		You look at the 
		proposal that was put forth by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia --<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Right.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#00004A">President Obama:</font></b> I might not agree 
		with every aspect of the proposal, but it took great courage --<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Absolutely.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> -- to put forward something that is as significant as 
		that.
		I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue 
		peace.
		I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the
		Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what's happening 
		with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> 
		Sure.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: </font></b> These things are interrelated. </font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> 
		Sure.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<b><font color="#00004F" size="2" face="Verdana">President Obama: </font></b> 
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">And what I've said -- and I think Hillary 
		Clinton has expressed this in her confirmation -- is that if we are 
		looking at the region as a whole and communicating a message to the Arab 
		world and the Muslim world, that we are ready to initiate a new 
		partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest, then I think 
		that we can make significant progress.</pbody></font></p>
		<p align="left"><pbody xmlns=""><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Israel is a strong ally of 
		the United States. They will not stop being a strong ally of the United 
		States. And I will continue to believe that Israel's security is 
		paramount. But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognize that 
		it is important to achieve peace. They will be willing to make 
		sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious 
		partnership on the other side.<br>
		<br>
		And so what we want to do is to listen, set aside some of the 
		preconceptions that have existed and -- and have built up over the last several 
		years. And I think if we do that, then there's a possibility at least of 
		-- of achieving some breakthroughs.<br>
		<br>
		</font></pbody>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b></font><pbody xmlns=""><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
		Now I want to ask you about the broader Muslim world, but let me -- one 
		final thing about the Palestinian-Israeli theater. There are many 
		Palestinians and Israelis who are very frustrated now with the -- with 
		the current 
		conditions and they are losing hope; they are disillusioned; and they 
		believe that time is running out on the two-state solution because -- 
		mainly because of the -- the settlement activities in...Palestinian-occupied 
		territories.
		Will it still be possible to see a Palestinian state -- and you know the 
		contours of it -- within the first Obama Administration?</font></pbody></p>
	
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#00004F">
		President Obama:</font></b> I think it is 
		possible for us to see a Palestinian state -- I'm not going to put a 
		time frame on it -- that is contiguous, that allows freedom of movement 
		for its people, that allows for trade with other countries, that allows 
		the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better 
		life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, look, I think anybody who has studied the region recognizes that 
		the situation for the ordinary Palestinian in many cases has not 
		improved. And the bottom line in all these talks and all these 
		conversations is: Is a child in the Palestinian Territories going to be 
		better off? Do they have a future for themselves? And, is the child in 
		Israel going to feel confident about his or her safety and security? And 
		if we can keep our focus on making their lives better and look forward, 
		and not simply think about all the conflicts and tragedies of the past, 
		then I think that we have an opportunity to make real progress.
		But it is not going to be easy, 
		and that's why we've got George Mitchell going there. This is somebody 
		with extraordinary patience as well as extraordinary skill, and that's 
		what's going to be necessary.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Let me take a broader look at the whole region. You are 
		planning to <a href="barackobamacairouniversity.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">address the Muslim world</font></a> in your first 100 days from a 
		Muslim capital. And everybody is speculating about the capital. If you have anything further, that would be great. How 
		concerned are you -- because, let me tell you, honestly, when I -- when 
		I see 
		certain things about America -- in some parts, I don't want to 
		exaggerate -- there is a demonization of America.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Absolutely.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> It's become like a new religion, and like a new religion it has new 
		converts, like a new religion has its own high priests.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Right.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> It's own, even, religious texts.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Right.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> And...in the last -- since 9/11 and because of Iraq, that alienation, 
		you know, is 
		-- is wider between the Americans. And...in generations past, the United 
		States was held high. It was the only Western power with no colonial 
		legacy.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Right.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> How concerned are you and...because people sense that you have a 
		different political discourse. And...I think, judging by [inaudible] and
		Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden and all these, that... --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> Yeah, I noticed.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		-- a chorus --<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">
		President Obama: </font></b> They -- They seem nervous.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> They seem very nervous, exactly. 
		And...now, tell me why they should be more 
		nervous? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#00004F">
		President Obama:</font></b> Well...I think that 
		when you look at the rhetoric that they've been using against me before 
		I even took office --<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> I know, I know.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> -- what that tells me is that their ideas are bankrupt.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem: </font></b>Absolutely.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: ...</font></b>There's no actions that they've taken that say a child in the Muslim 
		world is getting a better education because of them, or has better 
		health care because of them.<br>
		<br>
		In <a href="barackobamainauguraladdress.htm"><font color="#0000FF">my inauguration speech</font></a>, I've spoke[n] about: You will be judged on what 
		you built, not what you destroy. And what they've been doing is 
		destroying things. And over time, I think the Muslim world has 
		recognized that that path is leading no place, except more death and 
		destruction. <br>
		<br>
		Now, my job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a 
		stake in the well-being of the Muslim world that the language we use has 
		to be language of respect. You know, I have Muslim members of my family.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem: </font></b> True.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: </font></b> I have 
		lived in Muslim countries.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> The largest one.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> The largest one, Indonesia. And so what I want to
		communicate is the fact that in all my travels throughout the Muslim 
		world, what I've come to understand is is that regardless of your faith -- 
		and America is a country of Muslim[s], Jews, Christians, non-believers -- 
		regardless of your faith, people all have certain common hopes and 
		common dreams.</pbody></font></p>
		<p align="left"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And my job is to communicate to 
		the American people -- </font></p>

		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: </font></b> -- that the Muslim world is filled with extraordinary 
		people who simply want to live their lives and see their children live 
		better lives. My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the 
		Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not 
		been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America 
		was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and 
		partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 
		30 years ago -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> True.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> -- there's no reason why we can't restore that. And 
		-- And that I 
		think is going to be an important task.
		But ultimately, people are going to judge me not by my words but by my 
		actions and my Administration's actions. And I think that what you will 
		see over the next several years is that I'm not going to agree with 
		everything that some Muslim leader may say, or what's on a television 
		station in the Arab world; but I think that what you'll see is 
		somebody who is listening, who is respectful, and who is trying to 
		promote the interests not just of the United States, but also ordinary 
		people who right now are suffering from poverty and a lack of 
		opportunity. I want to make sure that I'm speaking to them, as well.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> And any decision on -- 
		on from where you will -- you will be addressing the Muslim world or is 
		too early?<br>
		<br>

		We are going to follow through on many of my commitments to do a more

		Muslim world.<br>
		<br>
		And I-- you're going to see me following through with dealing with a 
		drawdown of troops in Iraq, so that Iraqis can start taking more 
		responsibility. And finally, I think you've already seen a commitment, 
		in terms of closing Guantanamo -- </font></p>

		so respecting the rule of law that I think makes America great.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> President Bush framed the war on

		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem: </font></b> You've always framed it in a

		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> ...I think that you're making a very important point. And 
		-- And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand 
		is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any 
		other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for 
		violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of 
		the violence that is done in that faith's name.
		And so you will I think see our Administration be very clear in
		distinguishing between organizations like al Qaeda -- that espouse 
		violence -- </font></p>

		<b>Mr. Melhem: </b></font>True.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama: </font>-- </b> but still be respectful. I cannot respect 
		terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians and we will 
		hunt them down.
		But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a 
		hand of friendship.<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#008000">Mr. Melhem:</font></b> Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how 
		far are you going in...the direction of preventing it?<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="#00004F">President Obama:</font></b> You know, I said during the campaign that it is very 
		important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. 
		power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran.<br>
		<br>
		Now, the Iranian people are a great people. The Persian civilization is 
		a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to 
		peace and prosperity in the region -- their threats against Israel, their 
		pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off a[n] arms race 
		in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of 
		terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been 
		helpful.<br>
		<br>
		But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to 
		Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there 
		are potential avenues for progress. And we will, over the next several 
		months, be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said 
		during my <a href="barackobamainauguraladdress.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">inauguration speech</font></a>, if countries like Iran are willing to 
		unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.</font></p>
