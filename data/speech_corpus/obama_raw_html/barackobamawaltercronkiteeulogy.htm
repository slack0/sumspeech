<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Chip, Kathy, and 
			Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved 
			him; to Walter's friends, colleagues, protégés, and all who 
			considered him a hero; to the men of the Intrepid; to all of you who 
			are gathered here today; I am honored to be here to pay tribute to 
			the life and times of the man who chronicled our time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I did not know Mr. 
			Cronkite personally.&nbsp; And my regret is made more acute by the 
			stories that have been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did 
			I know him any better than the tens of millions who turned to him 
			each night in search of the answer to a simple question:&nbsp; &quot;What 
			happened today?&quot;&nbsp; But like them and like all of you, I have 
			benefited as a citizen from his dogged pursuit of the truth, his 
			passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view that 
			journalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital 
			to our democracy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even in his early 
			career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story 
			first in favor of getting it right.&nbsp; He wanted to get it first, but 
			he understood the importance of getting it right.&nbsp; During one of his 
			first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to go 
			on the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much 
			he loved fires -- a massive blaze at city hall that had already 
			claimed lives.&nbsp; When Walter reached for the telephone, his boss 
			asked, &quot;What are you doing; get on the air!&quot;&nbsp; Walter replied that he 
			was calling the fire department to confirm the story.&nbsp; &quot;You don't 
			need to confirm it,&quot; the manager shouted, &quot;my wife is watching the 
			whole thing!&quot;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Needless to say, Walter 
			made the call, and even as the program manager took to the air 
			himself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that 
			it had been nothing more than a small fire that hadn't resulted in 
			any injuries.&nbsp; He lost his job -- but he got the story right.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Walter wasn't afraid to 
			rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared to 
			compromise his integrity.&nbsp; He got along with elected officials, even 
			if they were wary of one another's motives.&nbsp; One politician once 
			remarked, &quot;Walter, my friend, you've got to believe me, fully 85 
			percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth.&quot;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He shared a complicated 
			relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on 
			their side even as they were convinced that he wasn't.&nbsp; President 
			Johnson called Walter after the evening news from time to time to 
			voice his displeasure over a certain story.&nbsp; But Walter knew that if 
			he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be 
			doing his job.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">His endless 
			inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother 
			who sold encyclopedias for a living.&nbsp; As a boy, Walter spent 
			countless hours getting lost within their pages, endlessly 
			sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from 
			one another, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's the way he 
			lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to 
			make sense of it and explaining it to others.&nbsp; He went everywhere 
			and he did everything.&nbsp; He raced cars and boats; he traveled 
			everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feet 
			below the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and 
			experienced weightlessness in the upper reaches of our atmosphere -- 
			all with one mission:&nbsp; to make it come alive for the rest of us.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as our world began 
			to change, he helped us understand those changes.&nbsp; He was forever 
			there, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and 
			milestones; scandal and success; calmly and authoritatively telling 
			us what we needed to know.&nbsp; He was a voice of certainty in a world 
			that was growing more and more uncertain.&nbsp; And through it all, he 
			never lost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he 
			gained growing up in the heartland.&nbsp; He was a familiar and welcome 
			voice that spoke to each and every one of us personally.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it may have seemed 
			inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America.&nbsp; But 
			here's the thing:&nbsp; That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network.&nbsp; 
			We weren't told to believe it by some advertising campaign.&nbsp; It was 
			earned.&nbsp; It was earned by year after year and decade after decade of 
			painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his belief 
			that the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and 
			unaccompanied by theatre or spectacle.&nbsp; He didn't believe in dumbing 
			down.&nbsp; He trusted us.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When he was told of this 
			extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America, he 
			naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his 
			wife.&nbsp; When people of both political parties actually tried to 
			recruit him to run for office, without even asking for his stances 
			on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential 
			opponents.&nbsp; And when, even a decade and a half after his retirement, 
			he still ranked first in seven of eight categories for television 
			journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth 
			category, &quot;attractiveness.&quot;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through all the events 
			that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments of 
			deepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling 
			the story of the American age.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is how we 
			remember him today.&nbsp; But we also remember and celebrate the 
			journalism that Walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and 
			integrity and responsibility to which so many of you have committed 
			your careers.&nbsp; It's a standard that's a little bit harder to find 
			today.&nbsp; We know that this is a difficult time for journalism.&nbsp; Even 
			as appetites for news and information grow, newsrooms are closing.&nbsp; 
			Despite the big stories of our era, serious journalists find 
			themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has 
			shrunk, so has the bottom line.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And too often, we fill 
			that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the 
			softer stories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and 
			investigative journalism he championed.&nbsp; &quot;What happened today?&quot; is 
			replaced with &quot;Who won today?&quot;&nbsp; The public debate cheapens.&nbsp; The 
			public trust falters.&nbsp; We fail to understand our world or one 
			another as well as we should –- and that has real consequences in 
			our own lives and in the life of our nation.&nbsp; We seem stuck with a 
			choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as a 
			society.&nbsp; Which price is higher to pay?&nbsp; Which cost is harder to 
			bear?</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;This democracy,&quot; Walter 
			said, &quot;cannot function without a reasonably well-informed 
			electorate.&quot;&nbsp; That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting 
			that so many of you pursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so 
			vital to our democracy and our society:&nbsp; Our future depends on it.&nbsp;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Walter was no naive 
			idealist.&nbsp; He understood the challenges and the pressures and the 
			temptations facing journalism in this new era.&nbsp; He believed that a 
			media company has an obligation to pursue a profit, but also an 
			obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and 
			public affairs.&nbsp; He was excited about all the stories that a 
			high-tech world of journalism would be able to tell, and all the 
			newly-emerging means with which to tell it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Naturally, we find 
			ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories 
			of our time.&nbsp; In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can 
			sweep around the world at the speed of the Internet, would he still 
			have called to double-check?&nbsp; Would he have been able to cut through 
			the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and the sound bites to 
			shine the bright light on substance?&nbsp; Would he still offer the 
			perspective that we value?&nbsp; Would he have been able to remain a 
			singular figure in an age of dwindling attention spans and 
			omnipresent media?</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And somehow, we know 
			that the answer is yes.&nbsp; The simple values Walter Cronkite set out 
			in pursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore 
			our world the best he could -- they are as vital today as they ever 
			were.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our American story 
			continues.&nbsp; It needs to be told.&nbsp; And if we choose to live up to 
			Walter's example, if we realize that the kind of journalism he 
			embodied will not simply rekindle itself as part of a natural cycle, 
			but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve to 
			value it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between 
			profit and progress is a false one -- and that the golden days of 
			journalism still lie ahead.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Walter Cronkite invited 
			a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust.&nbsp; 
			That's why so many of you entered the profession in the first 
			place.&nbsp; That's why the standards he set for journalists still 
			stand.&nbsp; And that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved 
			and valued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an 
			indispensable pillar of our society.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He's reunited with his 
			beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold with 
			boundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a 
			gleeful &quot;oh, boy!&quot;&nbsp; We are grateful to him for altering and 
			illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us to say 
			that, yes, we, too, were there.</font></div>
