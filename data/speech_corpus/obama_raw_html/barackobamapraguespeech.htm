			<p align="left"><b><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">*</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much. Thank

			Thank you to the people of the Czech Republic.<b><font color="#FF0000">*</font></b> </font>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, I'm proud to 
			stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center 
			of Europe. And, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, I am also 
			proud to be the man who brought Michelle Obama to Prague.<sup><font color="#FF0000">1</font></sup></font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Mr. President, Mr. 
			Prime Minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for 
			your extraordinary hospitality. And to the people of the Czech 
			Republic, thank you for your friendship to the United States.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've learned over many 
			years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the Czech 
			people in my hometown of Chicago. Behind me is a statue of a hero of 
			the Czech people -- Tomas Masaryk. In 1918, after America had 
			pledged its support for Czech independence, Masaryk spoke to a crowd 
			in Chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000. I don't think I 
			can match his record -- but I am honored to follow his footsteps 
			from Chicago to Prague. </font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For over a thousand 
			years, Prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other 
			place. You've known war and peace. You've seen empires rise and 
			fall. You've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics 
			and in poetry. Through it all, the people of Prague have insisted on 
			pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny. And this 
			city -- this Golden City which is both ancient and youthful -- 
			stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I was born, the 
			world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different 
			circumstances. Few people would have predicted that someone like me 
			would one day become the President of the United States. Few people 
			would have predicted that an American President would one day be 
			permitted to speak to an audience like this in Prague. Few would have imagined that the Czech Republic would become a free 
			nation, a member of NATO, a leader of a united Europe. Those ideas 
			would have been dismissed as dreams.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today 
			because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the 
			world could not change.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're here today because 
			of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that 
			freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall 
			they live on, and no matter what they look like.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today 
			because of the Prague Spring -- because the simple and principled 
			pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the 
			power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today 
			because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to 
			claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights 
			that had been denied them for far too long. Sametová Revoluce -- the 
			Velvet Revolution taught us many things. It showed us that peaceful 
			protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the 
			emptiness of an ideology. It showed us that small countries can play 
			a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the 
			way in overcoming old conflicts. And it proved that 
			moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I'm speaking 
			to you in the center of a Europe that is peaceful, united and free 
			-- because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, 
			even when their leaders did not. They believed that walls could come 
			down; that peace could prevail.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today 
			because Americans and Czechs believed against all odds that today 
			could be possible.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we share this 
			common history. But now this generation -- our generation -- cannot 
			stand still. We, too, have a choice to make. As the world has become 
			less divided, it has become more interconnected. And we've seen 
			events move faster than our ability to control them -- a global 
			economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old 
			conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">None of these challenges 
			can be solved quickly or easily. But all of them demand that we 
			listen to one another and work together; that we focus on our common 
			interests, not on occasional differences; and that we reaffirm our 
			shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us 
			apart.&nbsp; That is the work that we must carry on. That is the work 
			that I have come to Europe to begin.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To renew our prosperity, 
			we need action coordinated across borders. That means investments to 
			create new jobs. That means resisting the walls of protectionism 
			that stand in the way of growth. That means a change in our 
			financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we have an 
			obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to 
			extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who 
			are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to 
			do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion 
			dollars for the International Monetary Fund earlier this week, to 
			make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to protect our 
			planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy. 
			Together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's 
			dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of 
			energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do 
			their part. And I pledge to you that in this global effort, the 
			United States is now ready to lead.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To provide for our 
			common security, we must strengthen our alliance. NATO was founded 
			60 years ago, after Communism took over Czechoslovakia. That was 
			when the free world learned too late that it could not afford 
			division. So we came together to forge the strongest alliance that 
			the world has ever known. And we should -- stood shoulder to 
			shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an Iron 
			Curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This marks the 10th year 
			of NATO membership for the Czech Republic. And I know that many 
			times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the 
			table. Great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without 
			your voice being heard. I am here to say that the United States will 
			never turn its back on the people of this nation. We are 
			bound by shared values, shared history -- We are bound by shared 
			values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance. 
			NATO's Article V states it clearly: An attack on one is an attack on 
			all. That is a promise for our time, and for all time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The people of the Czech 
			Republic kept that promise after America was attacked; thousands 
			were killed on our soil, and NATO responded. NATO's mission in 
			Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of 
			the Atlantic. We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have 
			struck from New York to London, and helping the Afghan people take 
			responsibility for their future. We are demonstrating that free 
			nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security. And 
			I want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the Czech people 
			in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But no alliance can 
			afford to stand still. We must work together as NATO members so that 
			we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, 
			wherever they may come from. We must strengthen our cooperation with 
			one another, and with other nations and institutions around the 
			world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders. And we must 
			pursue constructive relations with Russia on issues of common 
			concern.&nbsp;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, one of those issues 
			that I'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our 
			nations and to the peace of the world -- that's the future of 
			nuclear weapons in the 21st century.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The existence of 
			thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the 
			Cold War. No nuclear war was fought between the United States and 
			the Soviet Union, but generations lived with the knowledge that 
			their world could be erased in a single flash of light. Cities like 
			Prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the 
			talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, the Cold War has 
			disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not. In a strange 
			turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but 
			the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up. More nations have acquired 
			these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear 
			secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb 
			has spread. Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one. 
			Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global 
			non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the 
			rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, understand, this 
			matters to people everywhere. One nuclear weapon exploded in one 
			city -- be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel 
			Aviv, Paris or Prague -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people. 
			And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the 
			consequences might be -- for our global safety, our security, our 
			society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some argue that the 
			spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that 
			we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more 
			people possess the ultimate tools of destruction. Such fatalism is a 
			deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear 
			weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to 
			ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just as we stood for 
			freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of 
			people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. And as 
			nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to 
			have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral 
			responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but 
			we can lead it, we can start it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I state 
			clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace 
			and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I'm not naive. This 
			goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It 
			will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the 
			voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 
			&quot;Yes, we can.&quot; </font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me describe to 
			you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will 
			take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put 
			an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear 
			weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the 
			same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United 
			States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter 
			any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including 
			the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our 
			arsenal.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To reduce our warheads 
			and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction 
			Treaty with the Russians this year. President Medvedev and I began 
			this process in London, and will seek a new agreement by the end of 
			this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold. And this 
			will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all 
			nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To achieve a global ban 
			on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and 
			aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
			Treaty. After more than five decades of talks, it is 
			time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And to cut off the 
			building blocks needed for a bomb, the United States will seek a new 
			treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials 
			intended for use in state nuclear weapons. If we are serious about 
			stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to 
			the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create 
			them. That's the first step.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, together we will 
			strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for 
			cooperation.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The basic bargain is 
			sound: Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, 
			countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all 
			countries can access peaceful nuclear energy. To strengthen the 
			treaty, we should embrace several principles. We need more resources 
			and authority to strengthen international inspections. We need real 
			and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules 
			or trying to leave the treaty without cause.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we should build a 
			new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an 
			international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power 
			without increasing the risks of proliferation. That must be the 
			right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons, especially 
			developing countries embarking on peaceful programs. And no approach 
			will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that 
			play by the rules. We must harness the power of nuclear energy on 
			behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace 
			opportunity for all people.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we go forward with 
			no illusions. Some countries will break the rules. That's why we 
			need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they 
			will face consequences.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just this morning, we 
			were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach 
			to address this threat. North Korea broke the rules once again by 
			testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles. This 
			provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this 
			afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to 
			prevent the spread of these weapons.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rules must be binding. 
			Violations must be punished. Words must mean something. The world 
			must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons. Now is 
			the time for a strong international response -- now is the time for 
			a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the 
			path to security and respect will never come through threats and 
			illegal weapons. All nations must come together to build a stronger, 
			global regime. And that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to 
			pressure the North Koreans to change course.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Iran has yet to build a 
			nuclear weapon. My administration will seek engagement with Iran 
			based on mutual interests and mutual respect. We believe in 
			dialogue. But in that dialogue we will present a clear choice. We 
			want Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, 
			politically and economically. We will support Iran's right to 
			peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections. That's a path 
			that the Islamic Republic can take. Or the government can choose 
			increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear 
			arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me be clear: 
			Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, 
			not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and our 
			allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in 
			agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the 
			threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense 
			system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian threat is 
			eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the 
			driving force for missile defense construction in Europe will be 
			removed.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, finally, we must 
			ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the 
			most immediate and extreme threat to global security. One terrorist 
			with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction. Al Qaeda 
			has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with 
			using it. And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material 
			across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of 
			purpose without delay.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today I am announcing 
			a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material 
			around the world within four years. We will set new standards, 
			expand our cooperation with Russia, pursue new partnerships to lock 
			down these sensitive materials.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must also build on 
			our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept 
			materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this 
			dangerous trade. Because this threat will be lasting, we should come 
			together to turn efforts such as the Proliferation Security 
			Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
			into durable international institutions. And we should start by 
			having a Global Summit on Nuclear Security that the United States 
			will host within the next year.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that there 
			are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad 
			agenda. There are those who doubt whether true international 
			cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations. 
			And there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons 
			and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to 
			achieve.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But make no mistake: We 
			know where that road leads. When nations and peoples allow 
			themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them 
			widens. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond 
			our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To 
			denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a 
			cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human 
			progress ends.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is violence and 
			injustice in our world that must be confronted. We must confront it 
			not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as 
			free people. I know that a call to arms can stir the 
			souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down. But that 
			is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those are the voices 
			that still echo through the streets of Prague. Those are the ghosts 
			of 1968. Those were the joyful sounds of the Velvet Revolution. 
			Those were the Czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire 
			without firing a shot.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Human destiny will be 
			what we make of it. And here in Prague, let us honor our past by 
			reaching for a better future. Let us bridge our divisions, build 
			upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more 
			prosperous and more peaceful than we found it. Together we can do 
			it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much. 
			Thank you, Prague.</font></p></div>
