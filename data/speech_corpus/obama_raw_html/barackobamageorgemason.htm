<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me 
		begin by thanking George Mason University for their extraordinary 
		hospitality and to thank all the great friends, the governors, the 
		mayors who are in attendance here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Throughout America's 
		history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next 
		without much notice or fanfare. And then there are the years that come 
		along once in a generation, the kind that mark a clean break from a 
		troubled past and set a new course for our nation. This is one of those 
		years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We start 2009 in the midst 
		of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has 
		only deepened over the last few weeks. Nearly two million jobs have been 
		now lost. And on Friday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs 
		last year than at any time since World War II. Just in the past year, 
		another 2.8 million Americans who want and need full-time work have had 
		to settle for part-time jobs. Manufacturing has hit a 28-year low. Many 
		businesses cannot borrow or make payroll. Many families cannot pay their 
		bills or their mortgage. Many workers are watching their life savings 
		disappear. And many, many Americans are both anxious and uncertain of 
		what the future will hold.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I don't believe it's 
		too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic 
		action as soon as possible. If nothing is done, this recession could 
		linger for years. The unemployment rate could reach double digits. Our 
		economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short of its full capacity, which 
		translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family of four. 
		We could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young 
		Americans are forced to forego dreams of college or the chance to train 
		for the jobs of the future. And our nation could lose the competitive 
		edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing 
		in the world. In short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This crisis did not happen 
		solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the business cycle. 
		And we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or 
		relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past. We arrived at this point due 
		to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate 
		board rooms to the halls of power in Washington, D.C.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For years, too many Wall 
		Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking 
		profits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, 
		and too little accountability. Banks made loans without concern for 
		whether borrowers could repay them, and some borrowers took advantage of 
		cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford. Politicians spent taxpayer 
		money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring 
		political points instead of problems they were sent here to solve. The 
		result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our 
		economy, our financial markets, and our government.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the very fact that this 
		crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond our 
		ability to solve. Our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our 
		capacity for future greatness. It will take time -- perhaps many years 
		-- but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence. We can restore 
		opportunity and prosperity. We should never forget that 
		our workers are still more productive than any on Earth. Our 
		universities are still the envy of the world. We are still home to the 
		most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and the most 
		advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known. And we 
		are still the nation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds. 
		If we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, I 
		know that we can do it again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why I have moved 
		quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an 
		American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump-start 
		job creation and long-term growth. It's a plan that represents not just 
		new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent 
		challenges. For if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture 
		of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin in 
		Washington. It's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of 
		responsibility. It's time to finally change the ways of Washington so 
		that we can set a new and better course for America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no doubt that the 
		cost of this plan will be considerable. It will certainly add to the 
		budget deficit in the short term. But equally certain are the 
		consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead 
		to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence in our 
		economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is true that we cannot 
		depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth. But at 
		this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost 
		necessary to lift us from a recession this deep and severe. Only 
		government can break the cycle that are [sic] crippling our economy, where a 
		lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even less spending, 
		where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even 
		less credit. That's why we need to act 
		boldly and act now to reverse these cycles. That's why we need to put 
		money in the pockets of the American people, create new jobs, and invest 
		in our future. That's why we need to restart the flow of credit and 
		restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never 
		happens again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now this plan begins with -- 
		this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save or create at 
		least three million jobs over the next few years. It's not just another 
		public works program. It's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and 
		promise of this moment: the fact that there are millions of Americans 
		trying to find work, even as all around the country there's so much work 
		to be done. And that's why we'll invest 
		in priorities like energy and education, health care and a new 
		infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in 
		the 21st century. That's why the overwhelming 
		majority of the jobs created will be in the private sector, while our 
		plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers, 
		firefighters, and others who provide vital services.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To finally spark the 
		creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production of 
		alternative energy in the next three years. We will modernize more than 
		75 percent of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 
		million American homes, saving consumers and taxpayers billions on our 
		energy bills.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the process, we will put 
		Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced, 
		jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing 
		fuel-efficient cars and buildings, and developing the new energy 
		technologies that will lead to even more jobs, more savings, and a 
		cleaner, safer planet in the bargain.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To improve the quality of 
		our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediate 
		investments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of 
		America's medical records are computerized. This will cut waste, 
		eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical 
		tests. But it just won't save 
		billions of dollars and thousands of jobs; it will save lives by 
		reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our 
		health care system.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph15" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To give our 
children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been more 
competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and 
public universities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries. We'll 
provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that 
students in Chicago and Boston can compete with children in Beijing for the 
high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph16" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To build an economy 
that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild America. Yes, we'll put 
people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating 
the backlog of well-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects. But 
we'll also do more to retrofit America for a global economy. That means updating 
the way we get our electricity by starting to build a new smart grid that will 
save us money, protect our power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver 
clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation. It means 
expanding broadband lines across America, so that a small business in a rural 
town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. It means investing in the science, research, and technology that will lead to 
new medical breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new industries.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph17" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And finally, this 
recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states, workers, 
and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession. To get people spending 
again, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut -- the first stage 
of a middle-class tax cut that I promised during the campaign and will include 
in our next budget. To help Americans who have lost their jobs and can't find 
new ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and 
health care coverage to help them through this crisis. Government at every level 
will have to tighten its belt, but we'll help struggling states avoid harmful 
budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the money to maintain 
essential services like police, fire, education, and health care.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph18" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now I understand that 
some might be skeptical of this plan. Our government has already spent a good 
deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higher 
incomes or renewed confidence in our economy. And that's why the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Plan won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in 
what works. The true test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're 
Democratic or Republican ideas, whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow our economy, 
and put the American Dream within the reach of the American people.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph19" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead of 
politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we 
invest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever 
possible. Every American will be able to hold Washington accountable for these 
decisions by going online to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being 
spent. And as I announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to 
eliminate unwise and unnecessary spending that has never been more unaffordable 
for our nation and our children's future than it is right now.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph20" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We have to make 
tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economy recovers, the 
deficits start coming down. We cannot have a solid recovery if our people and 
our businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in 
order. And that's why our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, 
but a foundation for long-term economic growth. That also means an 
economic recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects. I understand 
that every member of Congress has ideas about how to spend money. Many of these 
projects are worthy. They benefit local communities. But this emergency 
legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations. This must be a time 
when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own 
narrow interests.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph22" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, this recovery 
plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis. We must 
also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial 
system we all depend on. That means using our full arsenal of tools to get 
credit flowing again to families and businesses, while restoring confidence in our 
markets. It means launching a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis 
so that we can keep responsible families in their homes. It means preventing the 
catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse could endanger the 
entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clear 
understanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action 
that must come with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support. 
And it means reforming a weak and outdated regulatory system so that we can 
better withstand financial shocks and better protect consumers, investors, and 
businesses from the reckless greed and risk-taking that must never endanger our 
prosperity again.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph23" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No longer can we 
allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks. No longer can we 
allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales. No longer 
can we allow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to 
destructive cycles of bubble and bust. It is time to set a 
new course for this economy, and that change must begin now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We should have an 
open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but I 
urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people. 
For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will 
lose their jobs. More families will lose their savings. More dreams will be 
deferred and denied. And our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some 
point, we may not be able to reverse.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph25" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That is not the 
country I know. It is not a future I accept as President of the United 
States. A world that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and 
waiting for America to lead once more. And that is what we will do.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph26" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It will not come 
easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse 
before they get better. But that is all the more reason for Congress to act 
without delay. I know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the 
severity of our situation. We have already tried the wait-and-see approach to 
our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of 
reckoning.</font></p>
<p id="paragraph27" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that is why the 
time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work and 
responsibility are once again rewarded. That's why I'm asking Congress to work 
with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan 
passed in the next few weeks. That's why I'm calling on all Americans -- 
Democrats and Republicans and Independents -- to put -- to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological 
battles; a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship; and 
insist that the first question each of us asks isn't, &quot;What's good for me?&quot; but 
&quot;What's good for the country my children will inherit?&quot;</font></p>
<p id="paragraph28" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">More than any 
program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront these 
challenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down 
war, and depression, and fear itself. And if we do, if we are able to summon that 
spirit again, if we are able to look out for one another, and listen to one 
another, and do our part for our nation and for posterity, then I have no doubt 
that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one of those years that marked 
another new and hopeful beginning for the United States of America.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, 
God Bless You, and may God Bless America.</font></p>
