transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello, 
		Memphis! Congratulations to the class of 2011!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I will admit being 
		President is a great job. I have a very nice plane. I have a theme song. 
		But what I enjoy most is having a chance to come to a school like Booker 
		T. Washington High School and share this day with its graduates. So I 
		could not be more pleased to be here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've got some wonderful 
		guests who are here as well, and I just want to make mention of them 
		very quickly. First of all, the Governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, is 
		here. Please give him a big round of applause. Three outstanding members 
		of the Tennessee congressional delegation, all of whom care deeply about 
		education -- Senator Bob Corker, Senator Lamar Alexander, and 
		Congressman Steve Cohen is here. You've got one of Memphis's own, former 
		Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. is in the house. And the Mayor of Memphis, 
		A.C. Wharton is here. Please give him a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am so proud of each and 
		every one of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STUDENT: Thank you!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT: You're 
		welcome. You made it -- and not just through high school. You made it 
		past Principal Kiner. I've spent a little bit of time with her now, and 
		you can tell she is not messing around. I've only been in Memphis a 
		couple of hours, but I'm pretty sure that if she told me to do something 
		I'd do it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then I had the chance to 
		meet her mom and her daughter, Amber, a little while back, and we took a 
		picture. It turns out Amber actually goes to another high school. She 
		was worried that the boys would be afraid to talk to her if her mom was 
		lurking in the hallways -- which is why my next job will be principal at 
		Sasha and Malia's high school. And then I'll be president of their 
		college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me also say to Alexis 
		and Vashti -- I heard that you were a little nervous about speaking 
		today, but now I'm a little nervous speaking after you, because you both 
		did terrific jobs. We've had some great performances by Shalonda and 
		Tecia and Paula, and the jazz band. Give them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last but not least, I want 
		to recognize all the people who helped you to reach this milestone: the 
		parents, the grandparents, the aunts, the uncles, the sisters, the 
		brothers, the friends, the neighbors -- who have loved you and stood 
		behind you every step of the way. Congratulations, family. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want to acknowledge 
		the devoted teachers and administrators at Booker T. Washington, who 
		believed in you -- who kept the heat on you, and have never treated 
		teaching as a job, but rather as a calling.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every commencement is a 
		day of celebration. I was just telling somebody backstage, I just love 
		commencements. I get all choked up at commencements. So I can tell you 
		already right now, I will cry at my children's commencement. I cry at 
		other people's commencements. But this one is especially hopeful. This 
		one is especially hopeful because some people say that schools like BTW 
		just aren't supposed to succeed in America. You'll hear them say, &quot;The 
		streets are too rough in those neighborhoods.&quot; &quot;The schools are too 
		broken.&quot; &quot;The kids don't stand a chance.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are here today because 
		every single one of you stood tall and said, &quot;Yes, we can.&quot; Yes, we can 
		learn. Yes, we can succeed. You decided you would not be defined by 
		where you come from but by where you want to go, by what you want to 
		achieve, by the dreams you hope to fulfill. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a couple of years 
		ago, this was a school where only about half the students made it to 
		graduation. For a long time, just a handful headed to college each year. 
		But at Booker T. Washington, you changed all that. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You created special 
		academies for ninth graders to start students off on the right track. 
		You made it possible for kids to take AP classes and earn college 
		credits. You even had a team take part in robotics competition so 
		students can learn with their hands by building and creating. And you 
		didn't just create a new curriculum, you created a new culture -- a 
		culture that prizes hard work and discipline; a culture that shows every 
		student here that they matter and that their teachers believe in them. 
		As Principal Kiner says, the kids have to know that you care, before 
		they care what you know.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And because you created 
		this culture of caring and learning, today we're standing with a very 
		different Booker T. Washington High School. Today, this is a place where 
		more than four out of five students are earning a diploma; a place where 
		70 percent of the graduates will continue their education; where many 
		will be the very first in their families to go to college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, Booker T. 
		Washington is a place that has proven why we can't accept excuses -- any 
		excuses -- when it comes to education. In the United States of America, 
		we should never accept anything less than the best that our children 
		have to offer. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As your teacher Steve 
		McKinney -- where's Steve at? There he is. AKA Big Mac. And I see why 
		they call you Big Mac. As Mr. McKinney said in the local paper, &quot;We need 
		everyone to broaden their ideas about what is possible. We need parents, 
		politicians, and the media to see how success is possible, how success 
		is happening every day.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that's why I came here 
		today. Because if success can happen here at Booker T. Washington, it 
		can happen anywhere in Memphis. And if it can happen in Memphis, it can 
		happen anywhere in Tennessee. And it can happen anywhere in Tennessee, 
		it can happen all across America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So ever since I became 
		President, my administration has been working hard to make sure that we 
		build on the progress that's taking place in schools like this. We've 
		got to encourage the kind of change that's led not by politicians, not 
		by Washington, D.C., but by teachers and principals and parents, and 
		entire communities; by ordinary people standing up and demanding a 
		better future for their children. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have more work to do so 
		that every child can fulfill his or her God-given potential. And here in 
		Tennessee we've been seeing great progress. Tennessee has been a leader, 
		one of the first winners of the nationwide &quot;Race to the Top&quot; that we've 
		launched to reward the kind of results you're getting here at Booker T. 
		Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And understand, this isn't 
		just an issue for me. I'm standing here as President because of the 
		education that I received. As Chris said, my father left my family when 
		I was two years old. And I was raised by a single mom, and sometimes she 
		struggled to provide for me and my sister. But my mother, my 
		grandparents, they pushed me to excel. They refused to let me make 
		excuses. And they kept pushing me, especially on those rare occasions 
		where I'd slack off or get into trouble. They weren't that rare, 
		actually. I'm sure nobody here has done anything like that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm so blessed that they 
		kept pushing; I'm so lucky that my teachers kept pushing -- because 
		education made all the difference in my life. The same is true for 
		Michelle. Education made such a difference in her life. Michelle's dad 
		was a city worker, had multiple sclerosis, had to wake up every day and 
		it took him a couple hours just to get ready for work. But he went to 
		work every day. Her mom was a secretary, went to work every day, and 
		kept on pushing her just like my folks pushed me. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what's made a 
		difference in our lives. And it's going to make an even greater 
		difference in your lives -- not just for your own success but for the 
		success of the United States of America. Because we live in a new world 
		now. Used to be that you didn't have to have an education. If you were 
		willing to work hard, you could go to a factory somewhere and get a job. 
		Those times are passed. Believe it or not, when you go out there looking 
		for a job, you're not just competing against people in Nashville or 
		Atlanta. You're competing against young people in Beijing and Mumbai. 
		That's some tough competition. Those kids are hungry. They're working 
		hard. And you'll need to be prepared for it. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as a country, we need 
		all of our young people to be ready. We can't just have some young 
		people successful. We've got to have every young person contributing; 
		earning those high school diplomas and then earning those college 
		diplomas, or getting certified in a trade or profession. We can't 
		succeed without it. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through education, you can 
		also better yourselves in other ways. You learn how to learn -- how to 
		think critically and find solutions to unexpected challenges. I remember 
		we used to ask our teachers, &quot;Why am I going to need algebra?&quot; Well, you 
		may not have to solve for x to get a good job or to be a good parent. 
		But you will need to think through tough problems. You'll need to think 
		on your feet. You'll need to know how to gather facts and evaluate 
		information. So, math teachers, you can tell your students that the 
		President says they need algebra.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Education also teaches you 
		the value of discipline -- that the greatest rewards come not from 
		instant gratification but from sustained effort and from hard work. This 
		is a lesson that's especially true today, in a culture that prizes flash 
		over substance, that tells us that the goal in life is to be 
		entertained, that says you can be famous just for being famous. You get 
		on a reality show -- don't know what you've done -- suddenly you're 
		famous. But that's not going to lead to lasting, sustained achievement.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, with the 
		right education, both at home and at school, you can learn how to be a 
		better human being. For when you read a great story or you learn about 
		an important moment in history, it helps you imagine what it would be 
		like to walk in somebody else's shoes, to know their struggles. The 
		success of our economy will depend on your skills, but the success of 
		our community will depend on your ability to follow the Golden Rule -- 
		to treat others as you would like to be treated. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've seen how important 
		this is even in the past few weeks, as communities here in Memphis and 
		all across the South have come together to deal with floodwaters, and to 
		help each other in the aftermath of terrible tornadoes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of these qualities -- 
		empathy, discipline, the capacity to solve problems, the capacity to 
		think critically -- these skills don't just change how the world sees 
		us. They change how we see ourselves. They allow each of us to seek out 
		new horizons and new opportunities with confidence -- with the knowledge 
		that we're ready; that we can face obstacles and challenges and 
		unexpected setbacks. That's the power of your education. That's the 
		power of the diploma that you receive today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is something that 
		Booker T. Washington himself understood. Think about it. He entered this 
		world a slave on a Southern plantation. But he would leave this world as 
		the leader of a growing civil rights movement and the president of the 
		world-famous Tuskegee Institute.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Booker T. Washington 
		believed that change and equality would be won in the classroom. So he 
		convinced folks to help him buy farmland. Once he had the land, he 
		needed a school. So he assigned his first students to actually build the 
		chairs and the desks and even a couple of the classrooms. You thought 
		your teachers were tough. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Booker T. Washington ran a 
		tight ship. He'd ride the train to Tuskegee and scare some of the new 
		students. This is before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">
		<font color="#0000FF">YouTube</font></a> and
		<a href="http://www.tmz.com/"><font color="#0000FF">TMZ</font></a>, so 
		the kids didn't recognize him. He'd walk up to them and say, &quot;Oh, you're 
		heading to Tuskegee. I heard the work there is hard. I heard they give 
		the students too much to do. I hear the food is terrible. You probably 
		won't last three months.&quot; But the students would reply they weren't 
		afraid of hard work. They were going to complete their studies no matter 
		what Booker T. Washington threw at them. And in that way, he prepared 
		them -- because life will throw some things at you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth is, not a single 
		one of the graduates here today has had it easy. Not a single one of you 
		had anything handed to you on a silver platter. You had to work for it. 
		You had to earn it. Most of all, you had to believe in yourselves.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think of Chris's 
		stories, and what he's faced in his life: Lost his father to violence at 
		the age of four. Had a childhood illness that could have been 
		debilitating. But somehow he knew in his heart that he could take a 
		different path. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think of all the 
		graduates here who had to leave their homes when their apartments were 
		torn down, but who took two buses each morning to come back to Booker T. 
		Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think of Eron Jackon. 
		Where is Eron? Eron has known a lot of setbacks in her young life. There 
		was a period when she lashed out and she got into trouble and she made 
		mistakes. And when she first came to Booker T. Washington, she 
		struggled. Is that right? There are plenty of people out there who would 
		have counted Eron out; a lot of people who would have thought of her as 
		another statistic. But that's not how the teachers here at Booker T. 
		Washington saw her. And that's not how Eron came to see herself. So she 
		kept coming back to school, and she didn't give up and she didn't quit. 
		And in time, she became a great student. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And she remembered what 
		Principal Kiner told her: &quot;You can't let the past get you down. You have 
		to let it motivate you.&quot; And so now here Eron is, graduating. She's 
		going to keep studying to get her barber's certificate so she can cut 
		hair and save for college. She's working toward her dream to becoming a 
		lawyer. She's got a bright future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everybody here has got a 
		unique story like that to tell. Each of you knows what it took for you 
		to get here. But in reaching this milestone, there is a common lesson 
		shared by every graduate in this hall. And Chris said it himself in a 
		recent interview: &quot;It's not where you are or what you are. It's who you 
		are.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, you're from South 
		Memphis. Yes, you've always been underdogs. Nobody has handed you a 
		thing. But that also means that whatever you accomplish in your life, 
		you will have earned it. Whatever rewards and joys you reap, you'll 
		appreciate them that much more because they will have come through your 
		own sweat and tears, products of your own effort and your own talents. 
		You've shown more grit and determination in your childhoods than a lot 
		of adults ever will. That's who you are. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, class of 2011, the 
		hard road does not end here. Your journey has just begun. Your diploma 
		is not a free pass. It won't protect you against every setback or 
		challenge or mistake. You'll make some, I promise. You're going to have 
		to keep working hard. You're going to have to keep pushing yourselves. 
		And you'll find yourselves sometime in situations where folks have had 
		an easier time, they're a little bit ahead of you, and you're going to 
		have to work harder than they are. And you may be frustrated by that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if you do push 
		yourselves, if you build on what you've already accomplished here, then 
		I couldn't be more confident about your futures. I'm hopeful and I'm 
		excited about what all of you can achieve. And I know that armed with 
		the skills and experience and the love that you've gained at Booker T. 
		Washington High School, you're ready to make your mark on the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you. Thanks for 
		inspiring me. God bless you. God bless the United States.</font></p>
