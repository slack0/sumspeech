<font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good 
		evening, everybody. Please be seated. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Before I take your questions 
		tonight, I'd like to speak briefly about the state of our economy and 
		why I believe we need to put this recovery plan in motion as soon as 
		possible. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I took a trip to Elkhart, 
		Indiana, today. Elkhart is a place that has lost jobs faster than 
		anywhere else in America. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In one year, the 
		unemployment rate went from 4.7 percent to 15.3 percent. Companies that 
		have sustained this community for years are shedding jobs at an alarming 
		speed, and the people who've lost them have no idea what to do or who to 
		turn to. They can't pay their bill and they've stopped spending money. 
		And because they've stopped spending money, more businesses have been 
		forced to lay off more workers. In fact, local TV stations have started 
		running public service announcements that tell people where to find food 
		banks, even as the food banks don't have enough to meet the demand.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As we speak, similar scenes 
		are playing out in cities and towns across America. Last Monday, more 
		than a thousand men and women stood in line for 35 firefighter jobs in 
		Miami. Last month, our economy lost 598,000 jobs, which is nearly the 
		equivalent of losing every single job in the state of Maine. And if 
		there's anyone out there who still doesn't believe this constitutes a 
		full-blown crisis, I suggest speaking to one of the millions of 
		Americans whose lives have been turned upside down because they don't 
		know where their next paycheck is coming from. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that is why the single 
		most important part of this Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is 
		the fact that it will save or create up to 4 million jobs, because 
		that's what America needs most right now. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is absolutely true that 
		we can't depend on government alone to create jobs or economic growth. 
		That is and must be the role of the private sector. But at this 
		particular moment, with the private sector so weakened by this 
		recession, the federal government is the only entity left with the 
		resources to jolt our economy back into life. It is only government that 
		can break the vicious cycle where lost jobs lead to people spending less 
		money, which leads to even more layoffs. And breaking that cycle is 
		exactly what the plan that's moving through Congress is designed to do.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When passed, this plan will 
		ensure that Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their 
		own can receive greater unemployment benefits and continue their health 
		care coverage. We will also provide a $2,500 tax credit to folks who are 
		struggling to pay the cost of their college tuition, and $1,000 worth of 
		badly needed tax relief to working and middle-class families. These 
		steps will put more money in the pockets of those Americans who are most 
		likely to spend it, and that will help break the cycle and get our 
		economy moving. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But as we've learned very 
		clearly and conclusively over the last eight years, tax cuts alone can't 
		solve all of our economic problems -- especially tax cuts that are 
		targeted to the wealthiest few Americans. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We have tried that strategy, 
		time and time again. And it's only helped lead us to the crisis we face 
		right now. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that's why we have come 
		together, around a plan that combines hundreds of billions in tax cuts 
		for the middle class with direct investment in areas like health care, 
		energy, education and infrastructure, investments that will save jobs, 
		create new jobs and new businesses and help our economy grow again, now 
		and in the future. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">More than 90 percent of the 
		jobs created by this plan will be in the private sector. They're not 
		going to be make-work jobs but jobs doing the work that America 
		desperately needs done, jobs rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, 
		repairing our dangerously deficient dams and levees, so that we don't 
		face another Katrina.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">They'll be jobs building the 
		wind turbines and solar panels and fuel-efficient cars that will lower 
		our dependence on foreign oil and modernizing our costly health care 
		system that will save us billions of dollars and countless lives. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">They'll be jobs creating the 
		21st-century classrooms, libraries and labs for millions of children 
		across America. And they'll be the jobs of firefighters and teachers and 
		police officers that would otherwise be eliminated, if we do not provide 
		states with some relief. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now after many weeks of 
		debate and discussion, the plan that ultimately emerges from Congress 
		must be big enough and bold enough to meet the size of the economic 
		challenges that we face right now. It's a plan that is already supported 
		by businesses representing almost every industry in America, by both the 
		Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. It contains input, ideas and 
		compromises from both Democrats and Republicans. It also contains an 
		unprecedented level of transparency and accountability, so that every 
		American will be able to go online and see where and how we're spending 
		every dime. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What it does not contain, 
		however, is a single pet project, not a single earmark, and it has been 
		stripped of the projects members of both parties found most 
		objectionable. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now despite all of this, the 
		plan's not perfect. No plan is. I can't tell you for sure that 
		everything in this plan will work exactly as we hope, but I can tell you 
		with complete confidence that a failure to act will only deepen this 
		crisis, as well as the pain felt by millions of Americans. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My administration inherited 
		a deficit of over $1 trillion, but because we also inherited the most 
		profound economic emergency since the Great Depression, doing little or 
		nothing at all will result in ever -- even greater deficits, even 
		greater job loss, even greater loss of income and even greater loss of 
		confidence. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Those are deficits that 
		could turn a crisis into a catastrophe, and I refuse to let that happen. 
		As long as I hold this office, I will do whatever it takes to put this 
		economy back on track and put this country back to work. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I want to thank the members 
		of Congress who've worked so hard to move this plan forward. But I also 
		want to urge all members of Congress to act without delay in the coming 
		week to resolve their differences and pass this plan. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We find ourselves in a rare 
		moment where the citizens of our country and all countries are watching 
		and waiting for us to lead. It's a responsibility that this generation 
		did not ask for, but one that we must accept for the future of our 
		children and our grandchildren. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The strongest democracies 
		flourish from frequent and lively debate, but they endure when people of 
		every background and belief find a way to set aside smaller differences 
		in service of a greater purpose. That's the test facing the United 
		States of America in this winter of our hardship, and it is our duty as 
		leaders and citizens to stay -- stay true to that purpose in the weeks 
		and months ahead. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After a day of speaking with 
		and listening to the fundamentally decent men and women who call this 
		nation home, I have full faith and confidence that we can do it. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But we're going to have to 
		work together. That's what I intend to promote in the weeks and days 
		ahead. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And with that, I'll take 
		some of your questions. And let me go to Jennifer Loven at AP. There you 
		are. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. Earlier today in Indiana you said something striking. You 
		said that this nation could end up in a crisis, without action, that we 
		would be unable to reverse. Can you talk about what you know or what 
		you're hearing that would lead you to say that our recession might be 
		permanent when others in our history have not? And do you think that you 
		risk losing some credibility or even talking down the economy by using 
		dire language like that? </font></p>
		<div id="articleInline" class="inlineLeft">
			<div id="inlineBox">
				<div class="story">
					<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The latest on 
					President Obama, the new administration and other news from 
					Washington and around the nation.</font></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: No, no, no, no. I 
		think that what I've said is what other economists have said across the 
		political spectrum, which is that if you delay acting on an economy of 
		this severity, then you potentially create a negative spiral that 
		becomes much more difficult for us to get out of. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We saw this happen in Japan 
		in the 1990s, where they did not act boldly and swiftly enough, and as a 
		consequence they suffered what was called the &quot;lost decade,&quot; where 
		essentially for the entire '90s, they did not see any significant 
		economic growth. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So what I'm trying to 
		underscore is what the people in Elkhart already understand, that this 
		is not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill recession. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are going through the 
		worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We've lost now 3.6 million 
		jobs. But what's perhaps even more disturbing is that almost half of 
		that job loss has taken place over the last three months, which means 
		that the problems are accelerating instead of getting better. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, what I said in Elkhart 
		today is what I'll repeat this evening, which is I'm absolutely 
		confident that we can solve this problem, but it's going to require us 
		to take some significant, important steps. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Step number one, we have to 
		pass an economic recovery and reinvestment plan. And we've made 
		progress. There was a vote this evening that moved the process forward 
		in the Senate. We already have a House bill that's passed. I'm hoping 
		over the next several days that the House and the Senate can reconcile 
		their differences and get that bill on my desk. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There have been criticisms 
		from a bunch of different directions about this bill. So let me just 
		address a few of them. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the criticisms 
		really are with the basic idea that government should intervene at all 
		in this moment of crisis. You have some people, very sincere, who 
		philosophically just think the government has no business interfering in 
		the marketplace. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And in fact there are 
		several who have suggested that FDR was wrong to intervene back in the 
		New Deal. They're fighting battles that I thought were resolved a pretty 
		long time ago. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Most economists, almost 
		unanimously, recognize that even if philosophically you're -- you're 
		wary of government intervening in the economy, when you have the kind of 
		problem we have right now -- what started on Wall Street goes to Main 
		Street, suddenly businesses can't get credit, they start paring back 
		their investment, they start laying off workers, workers start pulling 
		back in terms of spending -- that when you have that situation, that 
		government is an important element of introducing some additional demand 
		into the economy. We stand to lose about $1 trillion worth of demand 
		this year and another trillion next year, and what that means is you've 
		got this gaping hole in the economy. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That's why the -- the figure 
		that we initially came up with, of approximately $800 billion, was put 
		forward. That wasn't just some random number that I plucked out of -- 
		out of a hat. That was Republican and Democratic, conservative and 
		liberal economists that I spoke to, who indicated that given the 
		magnitude of the crisis and the fact that it's happening worldwide, it's 
		important for us to have a bill of sufficient size and scope that we can 
		save or create 4 million jobs. That still means that you're going to 
		have some net job loss, but at least we can start slowing the trend and 
		moving it in the right direction.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, the recovery and 
		reinvestment package is not the only thing we have to do. It's one leg 
		of the stool. We are still going to have to make sure that we are 
		attracting private capital, get the credit markets flowing again, 
		because that's the lifeblood of the economy. And so tomorrow my Treasury 
		secretary, Tim Geithner, will be announcing some very clear and specific 
		plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit once again.
		</font></p>

				<div class="story">
					<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The latest on 
					President Obama, the new administration and other news from 
					Washington and around the nation.</font></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that means having some 
		transparency and oversight in the system. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It means that we correct 
		some of the mistakes, with TARP, that were made earlier, the lack of 
		consistency, the lack of clarity, in terms of how the program was going 
		to move forward. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It means that we condition 
		taxpayer dollars that are being provided, to the banks, on them showing 
		some restraint when it comes to executive compensation, not using the 
		money to charter corporate jets when they're not necessary. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It means that we focus on 
		housing and how are we going to help homeowners that are suffering 
		foreclosure or homeowners who are still making their mortgage payments 
		but are seeing their property values decline. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So there's going to be a 
		whole range of approaches that we have to take for dealing with the 
		economy. My bottom line is to make sure that we are saving or creating 4 
		million jobs, we are making sure that the financial system is working 
		again, that homeowners are getting some relief. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I'm happy to get good 
		ideas from across the political spectrum, from Democrats and 
		Republicans. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What I won't do is return to 
		the failed theories of the last eight years that got us into this fix in 
		the first place, because those theories have been tested and they have 
		failed. And that's part of what the election in November was all about. 
		Okay? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Caren Bohan of Reuters.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. I'd like to shift gears to foreign policy. What is your 
		strategy for engaging Iran, and when will you start to implement it? 
		Will your time table be affected at all by the Iranian elections? And 
		are you getting any indications that Iran is interested in a dialogue 
		with the United States? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: I said during the 
		campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, 
		extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many 
		years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and 
		prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks 
		or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like 
		Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards 
		Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a 
		nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of 
		destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but 
		I think are contrary to the interests of international peace. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What I've also said is that 
		we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources 
		at the United States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my 
		national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, 
		looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can 
		directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, 
		we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start 
		sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that 
		will allow us to move our policy in a new direction. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There's been a lot of 
		mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And it's important that even 
		as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain 
		deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we 
		find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're 
		clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms 
		race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are 
		going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but 
		I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of 
		mutual respect and progress.</font></p>

		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I think that if you look

		Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli 
		situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the 
		degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's 
		time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently as 
		well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the 
		international community, with those rights come responsibilities. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Chip Reid. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You have often said that 
		bipartisanship is extraordinarily important overall and in this stimulus 
		package. But now when we ask your advisers about the lack of 
		bipartisanship so far -- zero votes in the House, three in the Senate -- 
		they say, well, it's not the number of votes that matters; it's the 
		number of jobs that will be created. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Is that a sign that you are 
		moving away, your White House is moving away, from this emphasis on 
		bipartisanship? And what went wrong? Did you underestimate how hard it 
		would be to change the way Washington worked? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: I don't think -- 
		I don't think I underestimated it. I don't think the American people 
		underestimated it. They understand that there have been a lot of bad 
		habits built up here in Washington. And it's going to take time to break 
		down some of those bad habits. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You know, when I made a 
		series of overtures to the Republicans -- going over to meet with both 
		Republican caucuses, you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, 
		something that is unprecedented, making sure that they were invited here 
		to the White House, to talk about the economic recovery plan -- all 
		those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes. They were 
		designed to try to build up some trust over time. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I think that, as I 
		continue to make these overtures, over time, hopefully that will be 
		reciprocated. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But understand the bottom 
		line that I've got right now, which is what's happening to the people of 
		Elkhart and what's happening across the country. I can't afford to see 
		Congress play the usual political games. What we have to do right now is 
		deliver for the American people. So my bottom line when it comes to the 
		recovery package is send me a bill that creates or saves 4 million jobs, 
		because everybody has to be possessed with a sense of urgency about 
		putting people back to work, making sure that folks are staying in their 
		homes, that they can send their kids to college. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That doesn't negate the 
		continuing efforts that I'm going to make to listen and engage with my 
		Republican colleagues. And hopefully the tone that I've taken, which has 
		been consistently civil and respectful, will pay some dividends over the 
		long term. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are going to be areas 
		where we disagree and there are going to be areas where we agree. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As I said, the one concern 
		I've got on the stimulus package, in terms of the debate and listening 
		to some of what's been said in Congress is that there seems to be a set 
		of folks who -- I don't doubt their sincerity -- who just believe that 
		we should do nothing. Now, if that's their opening position or their 
		closing position in negotiations, then we're probably not going to make 
		much progress, because I don't think that's economically sound and I 
		don't think what -- that's what the American people expect, is for us to 
		stand by and do nothing. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There are others who 
		recognize that we've got to do a significant recovery package but 
		they're concerned about the mix of what's in there. And if they're 
		sincere about it, then I'm happy to have conversations about this tax 
		cut versus that -- that tax cut or this infrastructure project versus 
		that infrastructure project.</font></p>

					Washington and around the nation.</font></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But what I -- what I've been 
		concerned about is some of the language that's been used suggesting that 
		this is full of pork and this is wasteful government spending, so on and 
		so forth. First of all, when I hear that from folks who presided over a 
		doubling of the national debt, then, you know, I just want them to not 
		engage in some revisionist history. I inherited the deficit that we have 
		right now and the economic crisis that we have right now. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Number two is that, although 
		there are some programs in there that I think are good policy, some of 
		them aren't job creators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that 
		those programs should be out of this particular recovery package, and we 
		can deal with them later. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But when they start 
		characterizing this as pork without acknowledging that there are no 
		earmarks in this package -- something, again, that was pretty rare over 
		the last eight years -- then you get a feeling that maybe we're playing 
		politics instead of actually trying to solve problems for the American 
		people. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So I'm going to keep on 
		engaging. I hope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, 
		that everybody is willing to give a little bit. I suspect that the 
		package that emerges is not going to be a hundred percent of what I 
		want. But my bottom line is, are we creating 4 million jobs, and are we 
		laying the foundation for long- term economic growth? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is another concern that 
		I've had in some of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest 
		that what a waste of money to make federal buildings more 
		energy-efficient -- why would that be a waste of money? We're creating 
		jobs immediately by retrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 
		million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that 
		right there creates economic stimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when 
		it comes to federal buildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of 
		homeowners, they will see more money in their pockets. And we're 
		reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't 
		we want to make that kind of investment? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, maybe philosophically 
		you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in 
		energy policy. I happen to disagree with that. I think that's the reason 
		why we find ourselves importing more foreign oil right now than we did 
		back in the early '70s, when OPEC first formed. And we can have a 
		respectful debate about whether or not we should be involved in energy 
		policymaking, but don't suggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. 
		That's exactly what this country needs. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The same applies when it 
		comes to information technologies and health care. We know that health 
		care is crippling businesses and making us less competitive, as well as 
		breaking the banks of families all across America. And part of the 
		reason is we've got the most inefficient health care system imaginable. 
		We're still using paper. We're -- we're still filing things in 
		triplicate. Nurses can't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that 
		doctors have written out. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put 
		that on an electronic medical record that will reduce error rates, 
		reduce our long-term cost of health care, and create jobs right now?
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Education, yet another 
		example. The suggestion is, why should the federal government be 
		involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South 
		Carolina that was built in the 1850s. Kids are still learning in that 
		school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- 
		it's right next to a railroad, and when the train runs by the whole 
		building shakes and the teacher has to stop teaching for a while. The -- 
		the auditorium is completely broken down and they can't use it. So why 
		wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs 
		that are teaching our kids the skills they need for the 21st century, 
		that will enhance our economy and, by the way, right now will create 
		jobs?</font></p>

		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So, you know, we can differ 
		on some of the particulars, but again, the question I think that the 
		American people are asking is, do you just want government to do 
		nothing, or do you want it to do something? If you want it to do 
		something, then we can have a conversation. But doing nothing -- that's 
		not an option from my perspective. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All right. Chuck Todd. 
		Where's Chuck? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. In your opening remarks, you talked about that if your plan 
		works the way you want it to work, it's going to increase consumer 
		spending. But isn't consumer spending, or over-spending, how we got into 
		this mess? And if people get money back into their pockets, do you not 
		want them saving it or paying down debt first, before they start 
		spending money into the economy? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Well, first of 
		all, I don't think it's accurate to say that consumer spending got us 
		into this mess. What got us into this mess initially were banks taking 
		exorbitant, wild risks with other people's monies, based on shaky 
		assets. And because of the enormous leverage, where they had $1 worth of 
		assets and they were betting $30 on that $1, what we had was a crisis in 
		the financial system. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That led to a contraction of 
		credit, which in turn meant businesses couldn't make payroll or make 
		inventories, which meant that everybody became uncertain about the 
		future of the economy. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So people started making 
		decisions accordingly, reducing investments, initiating layoffs, which 
		in turn made things worse. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, you are making a 
		legitimate point, Chuck, about the fact that our savings rate has 
		declined. And this economy has been driven by consumer spending for a 
		very long time. And that's not going to be sustainable. You know, if all 
		we're doing is spending and we're not making things, then over time, 
		other countries are going to get tired of lending us money. And 
		eventually the party's going to be over. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, in fact, the party now 
		is over. And so the sequence of how we're approaching this is as 
		follows. Our immediate job is to stop the downward spiral. And that 
		means putting money into consumers' pockets. It means loosening up 
		credit. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It means putting forward 
		investments that not only employ people immediately but also lay the 
		groundwork for long-term economic growth. And that by the way is 
		important, even if you're a fiscal conservative, because the biggest 
		problem we're going to have, with our federal budget, is if we continue 
		a situation in which there are no tax revenues, because economic growth 
		is plummeting at the same time as we've got more demands for 
		unemployment insurance; we've got more demands for people who've lost 
		their health care, more demand for food stamps. That will put enormous 
		strains on the federal budget as well as the state budget. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So the most important thing 
		we can do for our budget crisis right now is to make sure that the 
		economy doesn't continue to tank. And that's why passing the Economic 
		Recovery Plan is the right thing to do, even though I recognize that 
		it's expensive.</font></p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Look, I would love not to 
		have to spend money right now. I'd -- you know, this notion that somehow 
		I came in here just ginned up to spend $800 billion, you know, that -- 
		that wasn't -- that wasn't how I envisioned my presidency beginning. But 
		we have to adapt to existing circumstances. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, what we are going to 
		also have to do is to make sure that as soon as the economy stabilizes, 
		investment begins again; we're no longer contracting, but we're growing; 
		that our midterm and long-term budget is dealt with. And I think the 
		same is true for individual consumers. Right now, they're just -- 
		they're just trying to figure out how do I make sure that if I lose my 
		job, you know, I'm still going to be able to make my mortgage payments.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Or they're worried about, 
		how am I going to pay next month's bills? So they're not engaging in a 
		lot of long-term financial planning. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Once the economy stabilizes 
		and people are less fearful, then I do think that we're going to have to 
		start thinking about how do we operate more prudently, because there's 
		no such thing as a free lunch. So if -- if you want to get -- if you 
		want to buy a house, then putting zero down and buying a house that is 
		probably not affordable for you in case something goes wrong, that's 
		something that has to be reconsidered. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So we're going to have to 
		change our -- our bad habits. But right now, the key is making sure that 
		we pull ourselves out of the economic slump that we're in. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All right. Julianna Goldman, 
		Bloomberg. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION Thank you, Mr. 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Many experts, from Nouriel 
		Roubini to Senator Schumer, have said that it will cost the government 
		more than a trillion dollars to really fix the financial system. During 
		the campaign, you promised the American people that you won't just tell 
		them what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Won't the 
		government need far more than the $350 billion that's remaining in the 
		financial rescue fund to really solve the credit crisis? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Well, the credit 
		crisis is real. And it's not over. I mean, we averted catastrophe by 
		passing the TARP legislation. But as I said before, because of a lack of 
		clarity and consistency in how it was applied, a lack of oversight in -- 
		in -- in how the money went out, we didn't get as a big of a bang for 
		the buck as we should have. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My immediate task is making 
		sure that the second half of that money, $350 billion, is spent 
		properly. That's my first job. Before I even think about what else I've 
		got to do, my first task is to make sure that my secretary of the 
		Treasury, Tim Geithner, working with Larry Summers, my national economic 
		adviser, and others, are coming up with the best possible plan to use 
		this money wisely, in a way that's transparent, in a way that provides 
		clear oversight; that we are conditioning any money that we give to 
		banks on them reducing executive compensation to reasonable levels and 
		to make sure that they're not wasting that money. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are going to have to work 
		with the banks in an effective way to clean up their balance sheets so 
		that some trust is restored within the marketplace, because right now 
		part of the problem is that nobody really knows what's on the banks' 
		books. Any given bank, they're not sure what kinds of losses are there. 
		We've got to open things up and restore some trust. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We also have to deal with 
		the housing issue in a clear and consistent way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I don't want to preempt my 
		secretary of the Treasury; he's going to be laying out these principles 
		in great detail tomorrow. But my instruction to him has been let's get 
		this right, let's create a template in which we're restoring market 
		confidence. And the reason that's so important is because we don't know 
		yet whether we're going to need additional money or how much additional 
		money we'll need until we've seen how successful we are at restoring a 
		sense of confidence in a marketplace that the federal government and the 
		Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC, working in concert, know what they're 
		doing.</font></p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That can make a big 
		difference, in terms of whether or not we attract private capital back 
		into the marketplace. And ultimately the government cannot substitute 
		for all the private capital that has been withdrawn from the system. 
		We've got to restore confidence, so that private capital goes back in.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Jake. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. My question follows Julianna's in content. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The American people have 
		seen hundreds of billions of dollars spent already. And still the 
		economy continues to free-fall. Beyond avoiding the national catastrophe 
		that you've warned about, once all the legs of your stool are in place--
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Right. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: -- how can the 
		American people gauge whether or not your programs are working? </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Can they -- should they be 
		looking at the metric of the stock market, home foreclosures, 
		unemployment? What metric should they use? When? And how will they know 
		if it's working or whether or not we need to go to a Plan B? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: I think my 
		initial measure of success is creating or saving 4 million jobs. That's 
		bottom line number one, because if people are working, then they've got 
		enough confidence to make purchases, to make investments. Businesses 
		start seeing that consumers are out there with a little more confidence. 
		And they start making investments, which means they start hiring 
		workers. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So step number one, job 
		creation. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Step number two, are we 
		seeing the credit markets operate effectively? You know, I can't tell 
		you how many businesses that I talk to that are successful businesses 
		but just can't get credit. Part of the problem in Elkhart that I heard 
		about today was the fact that this is the RV capital of America. You've 
		got a bunch of RV companies that have customers who want to purchase 
		RVs, but even though their credit is good, they can't get the loan.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, the businesses also 
		can't get loans to make payments to their suppliers. But when they have 
		consumers, consumers can't get the loans that they need. So normalizing 
		the credit markets is, I think, step number two. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Step number three is going 
		to be housing. Have we stabilized the housing market? Now, you know, the 
		federal government doesn't have complete control over that. But if our 
		plan is effective, working with the Federal Reserve Bank, working with 
		the FDIC, I think what we can do is stem the rate of foreclosure and we 
		can start stabilizing housing values over time. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And the most -- the biggest 
		measure of success is whether we stop contracting and shedding jobs, and 
		we start growing again. Now, you know, I don't have a crystal ball, and 
		as I said, this is an unprecedented crisis. But my hope is that after a 
		difficult year -- and this year is going to be a difficult year -- that 
		businesses start investing again, they start making decisions that, you 
		know, in fact, there's money to be made out there; customers -- or 
		consumers start feeling that their jobs are stable and safe, and they 
		start making purchases again. And if we get things right then, starting 
		next year, we can start seeing some significant improvement. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Ed Henry. Where's Ed? CNN. 
		There he is. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. You've promised to send more troops to Afghanistan. And since 
		you've been very clear about a time table to withdraw our combat troops 
		from Iraq within 16 months, I wonder what's your time table to withdraw 
		troops eventually from Afghanistan?</font></p>
		<div id="articleInline6" class="inlineLeft">

			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And related to that, there's 
		a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag-draped coffins 
		from coming into Dover Air Force Base. And back in 2004, then-Senator 
		Joe Biden said that it was shameful for dead soldiers to be, quote, 
		snuck back into the country under the cover of night. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You've promised 
		unprecedented transparency, openness in your government. Will you 
		overturn that policy, so the American people can see the full human cost 
		of war? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Your question is 
		timely. We got reports that four American service members have been 
		killed in Iraq today. And you know, obviously our thoughts and prayers 
		go out to the families. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I've said before that, you 
		know, people have asked me, &quot;When did it hit you that you are now 
		president?&quot; And what I told them was the most sobering moment is signing 
		letters to the families of our fallen heroes. It reminds you of the 
		responsibilities that you carry in this office and the consequences of 
		decisions that you make. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now with respect to the 
		policy of opening up media to loved ones being brought back home, we are 
		in the process of reviewing those policies in conversations with the 
		Department of Defense. So I don't want to give you an answer now, before 
		I've evaluated that review and understand all the implications involved.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With respect to Afghanistan, 
		this is going to be a big challenge. I think, because of the 
		extraordinary work done by our troops and some very good diplomatic work 
		done by Ambassador Crocker in Iraq, we just saw an election in Iraq that 
		went relatively peacefully, and you get a sense that the political 
		system is now functioning in a meaningful way. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You do not see that yet in 
		Afghanistan. They've got elections coming up, but effectively the 
		national government seems very detached from what's going on in the 
		surrounding community. In addition, you've got the Taliban and al Qaeda 
		operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan and 
		Pakistan. And what we haven't seen is the kind of concerted effort to 
		root out those safe havens that would ultimately make our mission 
		successful. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So we are undergoing a 
		thorough-going review. Not only is General Petraeus, now the head of 
		CENTCOM, conducting his own review, he's now working in concert with the 
		special envoy that I've sent over -- Richard Holbrooke, one of our top 
		diplomats -- to evaluate a regional approach. We are going to need more 
		effective coordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts 
		with development efforts with more effective coordination with our 
		allies in order for us to be successful. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The bottom line, though -- 
		and I just want to remember the American people, because this is going 
		to be difficult -- is this is a situation in which a region served as 
		the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000 Americans. And this past 
		week I met with families of those who were lost in 9/11, a reminder of 
		the costs of allowing those safe havens to exist. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My bottom line is that we 
		cannot allow al Qaeda to operate. We cannot have those safe havens in 
		that region. And we're going to have to work both smartly and 
		effectively, but with consistency, in order to make sure that those safe 
		havens don't exist. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I do not have yet a 
		timetable for how long that's going to take. What I know is I'm not 
		going to make -- I'm not going to allow al Qaeda or bin Laden to operate 
		with impunity planning attacks on the U.S. homeland. All right.</font></p>

		Helene? Here you go. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, sir.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I wanted to ask you, on the 
		next bank bailout, are you going to impose a requirement that the 
		financial institutions use this money to loosen up credit and make new 
		lending? And if not, how do you make the case to the American people 
		that this bailout will work when the last one didn't? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Again, Helene, I 
		-- I -- and I'm trying to avoid preempting my secretary of the Treasury; 
		I want all of you to show up at his press conference as well. 
		(Laughter.) He's going to be terrific. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But this relates to Jake's 
		earlier question. One of my bottom lines is whether or not credit is 
		flowing to the people who need it. Is it flowing to banks? Is -- excuse 
		me; is it flowing to businesses, large and small? Is it flowing to 
		consumers? Are they able to operate in ways that translate into jobs and 
		economic growth on Main Street? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And the package that we've 
		put together is designed to help do that. And beyond that, I'm going to 
		make sure that Tim gets his moment in the sun tomorrow, all right?
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Major Garrett. Where is 
		Major? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Mr. President, at 
		a speech Friday that many of us covered, Vice President Biden said the 
		following thing about a conversation the two of you had in the Oval 
		Office about a subject he didn't disclose. &quot;If we do everything right, 
		if we do it with absolute certainty, if we stand up there and we really 
		make the tough decisions, there's still a 30 percent chance we're going 
		to get it wrong.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the vice president 
		brought it up, can you tell the American people, sir, what you were 
		talking about? And if not, can you at least reassure them it wasn't the 
		stimulus bill or the bank rescue plan and if in general you agree with 
		that ratio of success, 30 percent failure, 70 percent success? </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: (Laughs.) You 
		know, I don't remember exactly what Joe was referring to, not 
		surprisingly. (Laughter.) But let me try this out. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I think what Joe may have 
		been suggesting, although I wouldn't put numerical -- I would ascribe 
		any numerical percentage to any of this, is that given the magnitude of 
		the challenges that we have, any single thing that we do is going to be 
		part of the solution, not all of the solution. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And as I said in my 
		introductory remarks, not everything we do is going to work out exactly 
		as we intended it to work out. This is an unprecedented problem. And you 
		know, when you talk to economists, there's some general sense of how 
		we're going to move forward. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There's some strong 
		consensus about the need for a recovery package of a certain magnitude. 
		There's a strong consensus that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one 
		basket, all tax cuts or all investment, but that there should be a range 
		of approaches. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But even if we do everything 
		right on that, we've still got to deal with what we just talked about, 
		the financial system and making sure that banks are lending again. We're 
		still going to have to deal with housing. We're still going to have to 
		make sure that we've got a regulatory structure -- a regulatory 
		architecture for the financial system that prevents crises like this 
		from occurring again. Those are all big, complicated tasks. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So I don't know whether Joe 
		was referring to that, but I use that as a launching point to make a 
		general point about these issues. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: I have no idea. I 
		really don't. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Michael Fletcher, The 
		Washington Post. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Yeah, thank you, 
		sir. What's you're reaction to Alex Rodriguez's admission that he used 
		steroids as a member of the Texas Rangers? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Yeah, I think 
		it's depressing news on top of what's been a flurry of depressing items, 
		when it comes to Major League Baseball. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And if you're a fan of Major 
		League Baseball, I think it -- it tarnishes an entire era, to some 
		degree. And it's unfortunate, because I think there are a lot of 
		ballplayers who played it straight.</font></p>

		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And you know, the thing I'm 
		probably most concerned about the message that it sends to our kids.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What I'm pleased about is, 
		Major League Baseball seems to finally be taking this seriously, to 
		recognize how big of a problem this is for the sport, and that our kids 
		hopefully are watching and saying: You know what? There are no 
		shortcuts; that when you try to take shortcuts, you may end up 
		tarnishing your entire career, and that your integrity's not worth it. 
		That's the message I hope is communicated. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All right. Helen. This is my 
		inaugural moment here. (Laughter.) I'm really excited. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Mr. President, do 
		you think that Pakistan and -- are maintaining the safe havens in 
		Afghanistan for these so-called terrorists? And also, do you know of any 
		country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Well, I think 
		that Pakistan -- there is no doubt that in the FATA region of Pakistan, 
		in the mountainous regions along the border of Afghanistan, that there 
		are safe havens where terrorists are operating. And one of the goals of 
		Ambassador Holbrooke as he is traveling throughout the region is to 
		deliver a message to Pakistan that they are endangered as much as we are 
		by the continuation of those operations, and that we've got to work in a 
		regional fashion to root out those safe havens. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">They're -- it's not 
		acceptable for Pakistan or for us to have folks who, with impunity, will 
		kill innocent men, women and children. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And you know, I -- I believe 
		that the new government of Pakistan and -- and Mr. Zardari cares deeply 
		about getting control of this situation, and we want to be effective 
		partners with them on that issue. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Did you get any 
		promise from them? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Well, Mr. 
		Holbrooke is there, and that's exactly why he's being sent there, 
		because I think that we have to make sure that Pakistan is a stalwart 
		ally with us in battling this terrorist threat. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With respect to nuclear 
		weapons, you know, I don't want to speculate. What I know is this: that 
		if we see a nuclear arms race in a region as volatile as the Middle 
		East, everybody will be in danger. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And one of my goals is to 
		prevent nuclear proliferation generally. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I think that it's important 
		for the United States, in concert with Russia, to lead the way on this. 
		And you know, I've mentioned this in conversations with the Russian 
		president, Mr. Medvedev, to let him know that it is important for us to 
		restart the conversation, about how we can start reducing our nuclear 
		arsenals in an effective way, so that -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: -- so that we 
		then have the standing to go to other countries and start stitching back 
		together the non- proliferation treaties that frankly have been weakened 
		over the last several years. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All right. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Sam Stein, Huffington Post. 
		Where's Sam? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Right here. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: There. Go ahead.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, Senator Patrick Leahy 
		announced that he wants to set up a truth and reconciliation committee 
		to investigate the misdeeds of the Bush administration. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">He said that before you turn 
		the page, you have to read -- read the page first. Do you agree with 
		such a proposal? And are you willing to rule out right here and now any 
		prosecution of Bush administration officials? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: I haven't seen 
		the proposal, so I don't want to express an opinion on something that I 
		haven't seen. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What I have said is that my 
		administration is going to operate in a way that leaves no doubt that we 
		do not torture, that we abide by the Geneva Conventions, and that we 
		observe our traditions of rule of law and due process as we are 
		vigorously going after terrorists that can do us harm. And I don't think 
		those are contradictory; I think they are potentially complementary.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My view is also that 
		nobody's above the law, and if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, 
		that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But 
		that generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I 
		am in looking backwards. I want to pull everybody together, including, 
		by the way, the -- all the members of the intelligence community who 
		have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect 
		America, and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush, without 
		adequate information.</font></p>
		<div id="articleInline9" class="inlineLeft">
			<div id="inlineBox9">
				<div class="story">
					<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The latest on 
					President Obama, the new administration and other news from 
					Washington and around the nation.</font></div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So I will take a look at 
		Senator Leahy's proposal, but my general orientation is to say let's get 
		it right moving forward. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Mara Liasson. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. 
		President. If it's this hard to get more than a handful of Republican 
		votes on what is relatively easy -- spending tons of money and cutting 
		people's taxes -- when you look down the road at health care and 
		entitlement reform and energy reform, those are really tough choices. 
		You're going to be asking some people to get less, and some people to 
		pay more. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What do you think you're 
		going to have to do to get more bipartisanship? Are you going to need a 
		new legislative model, bringing in Republicans from the very beginning, 
		getting more involved in the details yourself from the beginning, or 
		using bipartisan commissions? What has this experience with the stimulus 
		led you to think about when you think about these future challenges?
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">MR. OBAMA: Well, as I said 
		before, Mara, I think that old habits are hard to break. And we're 
		coming off of an election and I think people want to sort of test the 
		limits of what they can get. You know, there's a lot of jockeying in 
		this town and a lot of who's up and who's down and positioning for the 
		next election. And what I've tried to suggest is that this is one of 
		those times where we've got to put that kind of behavior aside, because 
		the American people can't afford it. The people in Elkhart can't afford 
		it. The single mom who's trying to figure out how to keep her house 
		can't afford it. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And whether we're Democrats 
		or Republicans, surely there's got to be some capacity for us to work 
		together -- not agree on everything, but at least set aside small 
		differences to get things done. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, just in terms of the 
		historic record here, the Republicans were brought in early and were 
		consulted. And you'll remember that when we initially introduced our 
		framework, they were pleasantly surprised and complimentary about the 
		tax cuts that were presented in that framework. Those tax cuts are still 
		in there. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I mean, I suppose what I 
		could have done is started off with no tax cuts, knowing that I was 
		going to want some, and then let them take credit for all of them. And 
		maybe that's the lesson I learned. But there was consultation. There 
		will continue to be consultation. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One thing that I think is 
		important is to recognize that because all these -- all these items that 
		you listed are hard, that people have to break out of some of the 
		ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for 
		too long. And let me give you a prime example. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When it comes to how we 
		approach the issue of fiscal responsibility, again, it's a little hard 
		for me to take criticism from folks, about this recovery package, after 
		they presided over a doubling of the national debt. I'm not sure they 
		have a lot of credibility when it comes to fiscal responsibility. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Having said that, I think 
		there are a lot of Republicans who are sincere in recognizing that 
		unless we deal with entitlements in a serious way, the problems we have, 
		with this year's deficit and next year's deficit, pale in comparison to 
		what we're going to be seeing 10 or 15 years or 20 years down the road.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Democrats and 
		Republicans are going to have to think differently in order to come 
		together and solve that problem. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I think there are areas like 
		education, where some in my party have been too resistant to reform, and 
		have argued only money makes a difference. And there have been others on 
		the Republican side or the conservative side who said, no matter how 
		much money you spend, nothing makes a difference, so let's just blow up 
		the public school systems. And -- and I think that both sides are going 
		to have to acknowledge we're going to need more money for new science 
		labs, to pay teachers more effectively. But we're also going to need 
		more reform, which means that we've got to train teachers more 
		effectively; bad teachers need to be fired after being given the 
		opportunity to train effectively; that we should experiment with things 
		like charter schools that are innovating in the classroom; that we 
		should have high standards. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So my whole goal over the 
		next four years is to make sure that whatever arguments are persuasive 
		and backed up by evidence and facts and proof, that they can work, that 
		we are pulling people together around that kind of pragmatic agenda. And 
		I think that there was an opportunity to do this with this recovery 
		package because, as I said, although there are some politicians who are 
		arguing that we don't need a stimulus, there are very few economists who 
		are making that argument. I mean, you've got economists who were 
		advising John McCain, economists who were advisers to George Bush -- one 
		and two -- all suggesting that we actually needed a serious recovery 
		package. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And so when I hear people 
		just saying we don't need to do anything; this is a spending bill, not a 
		stimulus bill, without acknowledging that by definition part of any 
		stimulus package would include spending -- that's the point -- then what 
		I get a sense of is that there is some ideological blockage there that 
		needs to be cleared up. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But I am the eternal 
		optimist. I think that over time people respond to -- to civility and 
		rational argument. I think that's what the people of Elkhart and people 
		around America are looking for, and that's what I'm -- that's the kind 
		of leadership I'm going to try to provide. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All right? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">STAFF: Thank you. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">QUESTION: One more, Mr. 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you, 
		guys.</font></p>
