		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello, Michigan!&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; First of all, give Joe 
			a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction.&nbsp;We've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody 
			has chairs, go ahead and use them.&nbsp;Feel free.&nbsp; We've 
			got some special guests here today that I just want to acknowledge.&nbsp; 
			All of you are special, but these folks I want to make sure that you 
			have a chance to see them.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First of all, one of the 
			best governors in the country, please give Jennifer Granholm a big 
			round of applause.&nbsp;Lieutenant Governor John Cherry -- 
			give John a big round of applause.&nbsp; One of my favorite 
			people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf 
			of working families each and every day -- Senator Debbie Stabenow.&nbsp; 
			We've got Speaker of the House, Andy Dillon, in the 
			house.&nbsp; We've got a lot of other local elected 
			officials, and I just want to thank them.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A couple of people who 
			are missing:&nbsp; Carl Levin, who is doing great work.&nbsp; He's in the Senate right now fighting on behalf of a bill to make 
			sure that we're not loading up a bunch of necessary defense spending 
			with unnecessary defense spending.&nbsp; So he's the point person on it.&nbsp; 
			The only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the 
			administration to get this bill done.&nbsp; Please give him a big round 
			of applause.&nbsp; Congressman Sandy Levin, also working 
			hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.&nbsp; 
			I want to go ahead and acknowledge the new mayor, since 
			he's the new mayor -- Mayor Dave Bing, great ball player.&nbsp;My game is a little like Dave Bing's -- except I don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling 
			skills -- or the endurance.&nbsp; Also don't have the 
			afro.&nbsp; Don't think I forgot that, Dave.&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp;I 
			remember that.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to 
			acknowledge that we've got the Executive Director of the White House 
			Council on Auto Communities and Workers, who's working hard, has a 
			direct line to me each and every day.&nbsp; He's traveling constantly 
			back here -- Ed Montgomery.&nbsp; Please give Ed a big round of 
			applause.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the Chairman of the 
			Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indian Tribe, Derek 
			Bailey is here.&nbsp; Please give Derek a big round of applause.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, the 
			president of the college where we are here, Jim Jacobs.&nbsp; Give Jim 
			Jacobs a big round of applause.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And those of you who 
			I've missed, you know how grateful I am that you're here.&nbsp; And thank 
			you all.&nbsp; It is wonderful to be back at Macomb.&nbsp; It was terrific 
			visiting this campus as a candidate, but I have to admit, it's even 
			better visiting as a President.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this is a place 
			where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take 
			their career to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has 
			the opportunity to pursue their dream, right here in Macomb.&nbsp; This 
			is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds -- even in 
			the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal 
			challenges -- can take a chance on a brighter future for themselves 
			and their families.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are folks like 
			Joe, who just told us his story.&nbsp; When Joe lost his job, he decided 
			to take advantage of assistance for displaced workers.&nbsp; He earned 
			his associate degree here at Macomb, and with a pretty impressive 
			GPA, I might add.&nbsp; And with the help of that degree, Joe found a new 
			job, working for the new Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital as a 
			maintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the 
			talents that he brought to make a fresh start.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are workers like 
			Kellie Kulman, who is here today. Where's Kellie?&nbsp; Raise your hand, 
			Kellie.&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; There you are.&nbsp; There's Kellie right 
			there.&nbsp; Kellie is a UAW worker at a Ford plant in 
			Sterling Heights, Michigan.&nbsp; She used to drive a fork 
			lift, right?&nbsp; But then she decided to train here at Macomb for a job 
			that required new skills, and now she's an apprentice pipe fitter.&nbsp; 
			It's a telling example:&nbsp; Even as this painful restructuring takes 
			place in our auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new 
			auto jobs.&nbsp; And Joe and Kellie's story make clear what all of you 
			know:&nbsp; Community colleges are an essential part of our recovery in 
			the present -- and our prosperity in the future.&nbsp; This 
			place can make the future better, not just for these individuals but 
			for America.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, since this 
			recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million Americans have lost their 
			jobs, and I don't have to tell you Michigan in particular has been 
			hard-hit.&nbsp; Now, I -- the statistics are daunting.&nbsp; The whole country 
			now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent.&nbsp; Here in 
			Michigan, it's about five points higher.&nbsp; And new jobs of course are 
			going to be coming out and we're going to see continuing job loss 
			even as the economy is beginning to stabilize.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that's not just 
			abstractions.&nbsp; Those just aren't numbers on a page.&nbsp; Those are 
			extraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals 
			who've worked hard all their lives and have done the right things 
			all their lives.&nbsp; If you haven't lost a job, chances are you know 
			somebody who has:&nbsp; a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a 
			coworker.&nbsp; And you know that as difficult as the financial struggle 
			can be, the sense of loss is about more than just a paycheck, 
			because most of us define ourselves by the work we do.&nbsp; That's part 
			of what it means to be an American.&nbsp; We take pride in work -- that 
			sense that you're contributing, supporting your family, meeting your 
			responsibilities.&nbsp; People need work not just for income, but because 
			it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so 
			important.&nbsp; And so when you lose your job, and when entire 
			communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavy burden, 
			that's a heavy weight.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, my administration 
			has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back 
			on its feet.&nbsp; That's my job.&nbsp;And it's a job I gladly 
			accept.&nbsp; I love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then 
			suddenly say, well, this is Obama's economy.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; Give it 
			to me.&nbsp; My job is to solve problems, not to stand on 
			the sidelines and harp and gripe.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I welcome the job.&nbsp; I 
			want the responsibility.&nbsp; And I know that -- let's just take an 
			example.&nbsp; Many questioned our efforts to help save GM and Chrysler 
			from collapse earlier this year.&nbsp; Their feeling was these companies 
			were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long 
			period of time, and like any business they should be held 
			accountable for those decisions.&nbsp; I agree that they should be held 
			accountable.&nbsp; But I also recognize the historic significance and 
			economic prominence of these companies in communities all across 
			Michigan and all across the country.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I thought about the 
			hundreds of thousands of Americans whose livelihoods are still 
			connected to the American auto industry, and the impact on an 
			already struggling economy, especially right here in Michigan.&nbsp; 
			So I said that if Chrysler and GM were willing to 
			fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices 
			necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a 
			process worth supporting.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now today, after a 
			painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both GM and Chrysler 
			have emerged from bankruptcy.&nbsp; Remember, folks said there was no way 
			they could do it?&nbsp; They've gotten it done already, in record time -- 
			far faster than anybody thought possible.&nbsp; They've got 
			a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision 
			of how to compete and win in the 21st century.&nbsp; Those sacrifices 
			were shared among all the stakeholders:&nbsp; workers and management; 
			creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.&nbsp; And together, 
			they've made the rebirth of Chrysler and GM possible.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was the right thing 
			to do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even with this 
			positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have 
			been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.&nbsp; 
			They're the casualties of a changing economy.&nbsp; In some cases, just 
			increased productivity in the plants themselves means that some jobs 
			aren't going to return.&nbsp; And that only underscores the importance of 
			generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones 
			that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they 
			create.&nbsp; For even before this recession hit, we were faced with an 
			economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, 
			well-paying jobs.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So now is the time to 
			change all that.&nbsp; What we face is far more than a passing crisis.&nbsp; 
			This is a transformative moment.&nbsp; And in this moment we must do what 
			other generations have done.&nbsp; It's not the time to shrink from the 
			challenges we face or put off tough decisions.&nbsp; That's what 
			Washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why I ran for 
			President -- to change that mindset.&nbsp; Now is the time 
			to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth that will not only 
			withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and 
			compete in a global economy.&nbsp; To build that foundation, we have to 
			slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt.&nbsp; 
			We're going to have to do that, and there's going to be 
			a major debate over the next three weeks.&nbsp; And don't be fooled by 
			folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care 
			system.&nbsp; We have no choice but to change the health care system, 
			because right now it's broken for too many Americans.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're going to have to 
			make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.&nbsp; But don't let 
			folks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to 
			get control of our health care costs, which is why we need reform.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now is the time to 
			create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new 
			clean energy economy.&nbsp; And Jennifer Granholm has been all on top of 
			this as the governor of Michigan.&nbsp; She is bring cleaning [sic] 
			energy jobs right here to Michigan, and we've got to support her in 
			that effort.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want Michigan to build 
			windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants and 
			energy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, 
			Michigan, you know bad weather.&nbsp; So you can be all on 
			top of weatherizing.&nbsp; You need to weatherize.&nbsp; I know 
			about that in Chicago too.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we also have to 
			ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new 
			jobs of the 21st century.&nbsp; We've got to prepare our people with the 
			skills they need to compete in this global economy.&nbsp;Time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, 
			we have prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible 
			innovative and generative potential of a skilled American 
			workforce.&nbsp; That's what happened when President Lincoln signed into 
			law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only 
			transformed higher education, but also our entire economy.&nbsp; That's 
			what took place when President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill which 
			helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented 
			prosperity.&nbsp; That was the foundation for the American middle class.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why, at the 
			start of my administration I set a goal for America:&nbsp; By 2020, this 
			nation will once again have the highest proportion of college 
			graduates in the world.&nbsp; We used to have that.&nbsp; We're going to have 
			it again.&nbsp;And we've begun to take historic steps to 
			achieve this goal.&nbsp; Already we've increased Pell grants by $500.&nbsp;We've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of 
			college tuition.&nbsp;We've simplified student aid 
			applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a 
			job that you just lost.&nbsp;A new GI Bill of Rights for 
			the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from Iraq 
			and Afghanistan to begin a new life -- in a new economy.&nbsp; And the 
			recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls -- which put 
			enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- 
			at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and 
			classrooms and facilities all across America.&nbsp; So we've already 
			taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century 
			education system here in America, one that will allow us to compete 
			with China and India and everybody else all around the world.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">But today I'm announcing 
			the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having 
			the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.&nbsp; 
			We're going to achieve this in the next 10 years.&nbsp; And 
			it's called the American Graduation Initiative.&nbsp; It will reform and 
			strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast so 
			they get the resources that students and schools need -- and the 
			results workers and businesses demand.&nbsp; Through this plan, we seek 
			to help an additional 5 million Americans earn degrees and 
			certificates in the next decade -- 5 million.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not since the passage of 
			the original GI Bill and the work of President Truman's Commission 
			on Higher Education -- which helped to double the number of 
			community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those 
			colleges -- have we taken such a historic step on behalf of 
			community colleges in America.&nbsp; And let me be clear:&nbsp; We pay for 
			this plan -- this isn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this 
			plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to 
			banks and private lenders for student loans.&nbsp; That will 
			save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.&nbsp; Instead of 
			lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went 
			towards the interests of higher education in America.&nbsp; That's what my administration is committed to doing.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that for a 
			long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as 
			a silver bullet and college as a cure-all.&nbsp; It's not, and we know 
			that.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you 
			talk to them about training and they say, &quot;Training for what?&quot;&nbsp; So I 
			understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if 
			the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are 
			being created out there.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we know that in the 
			coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are 
			projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college 
			experience.&nbsp; We will not fill those jobs -- or even keep those jobs 
			here in America -- without the training offered by community 
			colleges.&nbsp; That's why I want to applaud Governor Granholm for the No 
			Worker Left Behind program.&nbsp; It's providing up to two 
			years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities 
			across the state.&nbsp; The rest of the country should learn from the 
			effort.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is training to 
			become a medical technician, or a health IT worker, or a lab 
			specialist, or a nurse.&nbsp; In fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come 
			from community colleges.&nbsp; This is training to install 
			solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and 
			develop a smarter electricity grid.&nbsp; And this is the kind of 
			education that more and more Americans are using to improve their 
			skills and broaden their horizons.&nbsp; Many young people are saving 
			money by spending two years at community college before heading to a 
			four-year college.&nbsp; And more workers who have lost their jobs -- or 
			fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge at schools like this one.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, 
			community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments 
			and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face 
			budget shortfalls.&nbsp; And this is in addition to the challenges you 
			face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding 
			per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.&nbsp; So 
			community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country.&nbsp; Not 
			only is that not right, it's not smart.&nbsp; That's why I've asked Dr. 
			Jill Biden -- who happens to be a relation of the Vice President, 
			Joe Biden, but who is also a community college educator for more 
			than 16 years -- to promote community colleges and help us make 
			community colleges stronger.&nbsp; And that's why we're putting in place 
			this American Graduation Initiative.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me describe for you 
			the specifics of what we're going to do.&nbsp; Number one, we will offer 
			competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue 
			innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal 
			funding.&nbsp; We'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs 
			with businesses that are looking to hire.&nbsp; We'll challenge these 
			schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the 
			basics, like math and science, that are essential to our 
			competitiveness.&nbsp; We'll put colleges and employers together to 
			create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs 
			of the boardroom.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are all kinds of 
			-- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.&nbsp; We've seen 
			Cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare 
			students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to 
			health IT.&nbsp; We know that the most successful community colleges are 
			those that partner with the private sector.&nbsp; So we want to encourage 
			more companies to work with schools to build these type of 
			relationships.&nbsp; That way, when somebody goes through a training 
			program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We'll also create a new 
			research center with a simple mission:&nbsp; to measure what works and 
			what doesn't.&nbsp; All too often, we don't know what happens when 
			somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into 
			the library or -- the laboratory or the office.&nbsp; And that means 
			businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.&nbsp; And 
			schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices 
			about which programs receive -- achieve results and which programs 
			don't.&nbsp; And this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, 
			but for students and workers, as well.&nbsp; If a parent is going to 
			spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family -- 
			especially after a long day at work -- that degree really has to 
			mean something.&nbsp; They have to know that when they get that degree, 
			this is going to help advance their goals.&nbsp; If a worker is going to 
			spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that 
			certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses 
			are ready to hire.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, we want to 
			propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just 
			enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that 
			program.&nbsp; See, more than half -- more than half of all 
			students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or 
			transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, 
			unfortunately fail to reach their goal.&nbsp; That's not just a waste of 
			a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students.&nbsp; 
			Oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but 
			they still have to pay back the debt.&nbsp; And it's a disaster for our 
			economy.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we'll fund programs 
			that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.&nbsp; Let's 
			figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, 
			and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers.&nbsp; 
			Maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or 
			too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.&nbsp; Maybe a 
			young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to 
			employment.&nbsp; The point is, we need to figure out solutions for these 
			kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't 
			prevent you from reaching your potential.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All right, so that's a 
			big chunk of this first part of this initiative.&nbsp; The second part:&nbsp; 
			We're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild 
			college classrooms and buildings all across the country.&nbsp;All too often, community colleges are treated like the 
			stepchild of the higher education system; they're an afterthought, 
			if they're thought of at all.&nbsp; And that means schools are often 
			years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st 
			century economy, they're years behind in the education they can 
			offer.&nbsp; That's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct.&nbsp; 
			Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more 
			affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on 
			the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate 
			schools, including community colleges all across the country.&nbsp; And 
			by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training 
			that they're providing, guess what?&nbsp; You also have to hire some 
			workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those 
			schools.&nbsp; So it means it's putting people to work in Michigan right 
			here right now.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number three:&nbsp; Even as 
			we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new 
			virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training 
			community colleges can offer.&nbsp; So we're going to support the 
			creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so 
			that community colleges across the country can offer more classes 
			without building more classrooms.&nbsp; And this will make a big 
			difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have 
			struggled -- attract -- have to struggle to attract students and 
			faculty.&nbsp; And this will make it possible for a professor to 
			complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who 
			can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.&nbsp; 
			We don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's 
			exactly why we ought to try it because I think there's a possibility 
			that online education can provide especially for people who are 
			already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade 
			their skills without having to quit their job.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me say this 
			more:&nbsp; The road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be 
			hard.&nbsp; It was never going to be easy.&nbsp; When I was sworn in, we were 
			seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lost that month.&nbsp; Then we had the same 
			amount lost for two more consecutive months.&nbsp; Now we've got an 
			average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too 
			many jobs.&nbsp; We will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, 
			but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're 
			actually creating jobs.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it's going to take 
			time.&nbsp; There are going to be false starts and there are going to be 
			setbacks.&nbsp; But I am confident that we can meet the challenges we 
			face, because that's what we've always done.&nbsp; That's what America 
			does.&nbsp; We hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then 
			we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.&nbsp; 
			That's what we see on display right here at Macomb Community 
			College.&nbsp; That's what I've seen at colleges and universities all 
			across this country.&nbsp; At every juncture in our history when we've 
			been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the 
			industriousness -- that can-do American spirit -- that has allowed 
			us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what we can and 
			must do now, not just to overcome this crisis, but to leave 
			something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children 
			and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their 
			future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficult 
			moment, are taking responsibility for theirs.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am absolutely 
			confident that if I've got your help, that we can make it happen, 
			and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous Michigan in the 
			years to come.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
			Warren.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God bless the United States of America.</font></div>
