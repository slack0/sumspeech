<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, everybody, for being here.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">As we all know, our country has endured the deepest 
recession we've faced in generations.&nbsp;And much of the turmoil was caused by 
irresponsibility on the part of banks and financial institutions. Firms took 
reckless risks in pursuit of short-term profits and soaring bonuses, triggering 
a financial crisis that nearly pulled the economy into a second 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"><font color="#0000FF">Great 
Depression</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">It was little more than a year ago that we stood on 
that precipice. Several of the world's largest financial institutions had 
already failed.&nbsp;Credit markets froze and banks refused to lend.&nbsp;Trillions of 
dollars in household savings evaporated as stocks, pensions, and home values 
plummeted.&nbsp;And we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs each month.&nbsp;It was 
at this time that many large financial firms -- those left standing -- teetered 
on the brink of collapse, overwhelmed by the consequences of their irresponsible 
decisions.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, even though these firms were largely facing a crisis 
of their own making, their failure could have led to an even greater calamity 
for the country. So the Federal Reserve and other agencies took emergency 
measures to prevent that outcome.&nbsp;And the previous Administration started a 
program -- the 
<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benbernankenewyorkeconomicclub.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">Troubled Asset Relief Program</font></a>, or TARP -- to provide these 
financial institutions with funds to survive the turmoil that they had helped 
unleash.&nbsp;It was a distasteful but necessary thing to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, we've worked over the last year to manage this 
program effectively, to hold firms accountable, and to recoup as much tax money 
as possible.&nbsp;Many originally feared that most of the 700 billion dollars in TARP money 
would be lost.&nbsp;But because of the management of this program by Secretary 
Geithner and my economic team, we've now recovered the majority of the funds 
provided to banks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As far as I'm concerned, 
		however, that's not good enough.&nbsp;My commitment is to the taxpayer.&nbsp; My 
		commitment is to recover every single dime the American people are 
		owed.&nbsp;And my determination to achieve this goal is only heightened when 
		I see reports of massive profits and obscene bonuses at some of the very 
		firms who owe their continued existence to the American people -- folks 
		who have not been made whole, and who continue to face real hardship in 
		this recession.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We want our money back. And 
		we're going to get it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why I'm proposing a 
		&quot;Financial Crisis 
		Responsibility Fee&quot; to be imposed on major financial firms until the 
		American people are fully compensated for the extraordinary assistance 
		they provided to Wall Street.&nbsp;If these companies are in good enough 
		shape to afford massive bonuses, they are surely in good enough shape to 
		afford paying back every penny to taxpayers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, our estimate is that 
		the TARP program will end up costing taxpayers around 117 billion dollars -- obviously a lot less than the 700 billion that people 
		had feared, but still a lot of money.&nbsp;The fee will be in place for 10 
		years, or as long as it takes to raise the full amount necessary to 
		cover all taxpayer losses. This will not be a cost borne by community 
		banks or small financial firms. Only the largest firms with more than 
		50 billion dollars in assets will be affected.&nbsp;And the size of the fee each 
		bank owes will be based on its size and exposure to debt, so that we are 
		recovering tax dollars while promoting reform of the banking practices 
		that contributed to this crisis.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the fact is these 
		financial institutions are essential to our economy.&nbsp;They provide 
		capital and credit to families purchasing homes, students attending 
		college, businesses seeking to start up or expand.&nbsp;And that's why the 
		rescue program was as necessary as it was unfortunate.&nbsp; And that is why, 
		through this fee and broader reforms that we seek, our goal is not to 
		punish Wall Street firms, but rather to prevent the abuse and excess 
		that nearly caused the collapse of many of these firms and the financial 
		system itself.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot go back to 
		&quot;business as usual.&quot;&nbsp;And when we see reports of firms once again engaging 
		in risky bets to reap quick rewards, when we see a return to 
		compensation practices that seem not to reflect what the country has 
		been through, all that looks like business as usual to me.&nbsp;The financial 
		industry has even launched a massive lobbying campaign, locking arms 
		with the opposition Party, to stand in the way of reforms to prevent 
		another crisis. That, too, unfortunately, is business as usual. And 
		we're already hearing a hue and cry from Wall Street suggesting that 
		this proposed fee is not only unwelcome but unfair -- that by some 
		twisted logic it is more appropriate for the American people to bear the 
		costs of the bailout, rather than the industry that benefited from it, 
		even though these executives are out there giving themselves huge 
		bonuses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What I'd say to these 
		executives is this:&nbsp;Instead of sending a 
		<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/phalanx"><font color="#0000FF">phalanx</font></a> of lobbyists to fight 
		this proposal, or employing an army of lawyers and accountants to help 
		evade the fee, I suggest you might want to consider simply meeting your 
		responsibilities.&nbsp;And I'd urge you to cover the costs of the rescue not 
		by sticking it to your shareholders or your customers or fellow citizens 
		with the bill, but by rolling back bonuses for top earners and 
		executives. And more broadly, I am continuing to call on these firms to 
		put greater effort into helping families stay in their homes, to provide 
		small businesses with needed loans, and to embrace -- rather than fight 
		-- serious financial reform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ultimately, it is by taking 
		responsibility -- on Wall Street, here in Washington, all the way to 
		Main Street -- that we're going to move past this period of 
		turmoil.&nbsp;That's how we're going to avoid the cycles of boom and bust 
		that have caused so much havoc. That's how we're going to promote 
		vibrant markets that reward innovation and entrepreneurship and hard 
		work.&nbsp;That's how we're going to create sustained growth without the 
		looming threat of another costly crisis.&nbsp;That's not only in the best 
		interests of the economy as a whole; it's actually in the interest of 
		these large banks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, I'm going to be working 
		closely with Congress on this proposal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And on behalf of the American 
		people, I look forward to signing it into law.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
