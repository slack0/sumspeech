transcribed directly from audio] </font></p>
		</font>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<p align="left">Madame Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of 
			Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:</p>
		<p align="left">Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the 
		President shall give to Congress information about the state of our 
		union. For two hundred and twenty years, our leaders [have] fulfilled this 
		duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. 
		And they've done so in the midst of war and depression -- at moments of 
		great strife and great struggle.</p>
		<p align="left">It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume 
		that our progress was inevitable -- that America was always destined to 
		succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies 
		first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the 
		market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on 
		Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times 
		that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our 
		union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations 
		and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one 
		nation, and one people.</p>
		<p align="left">Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer 
		history's call.</p>
		<p align="left">One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy 
		rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, 
		and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political 
		spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second 
		depression. So we acted -- immediately and aggressively. And one year 
		later, the worst of the storm has passed.</p>
		<p align="left">But the devastation remains. One in ten Americans still 
		cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have 
		declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially 
		hard. And for those who had already known poverty, life's become that much 
		harder.</p>
		<p align="left">And this recession has also compounded the burdens that 
		America's families have been dealing with for decades: the burden of 
		working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to 
		retire, or help kids with college.</p>
		<p align="left">So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. 
		They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. 
		These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like 
		Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the 
		letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written 
		by children, asking why they have to move from their home, asking or when 
		their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.</p>
		<p align="left">For these Americans and so many others, change has not 
		come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't 
		understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded but 
		hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or 
		unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the 
		partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't 
		afford it. Not now.</p>
		<p align="left">So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the 
		American people hope -- what they deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats 
		and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the 
		numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here 
		have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the 
		anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: 
		a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead. Most of all, the 
		ability to give their children a better life.</p>
		<p align="left">And you know what else they share? They share a stubborn 
		resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult 
		years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, 
		starting businesses, and going back to school. They're coaching little 
		league and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, &quot;We are 
		strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.&quot;</p>
		<p align="left">It's because of this spirit -- this great decency and 
		great strength -- that I have never been more hopeful about America's 
		future than I am tonight.</p>
		<p align="left">Despite -- Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We 
		do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to 
		break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get 
		a government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength. 
		And tonight -- tonight I'd like to talk about how, together, we can 
		deliver on that promise. </p>
		<p align="left">It begins with our economy.
		</font>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2" /p>
			Our 
			most urgent -- Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks 
			that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's 
			one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans -- and 
		everybody in between -- it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated 
		it -- I hated it -- I hated it. You hated it. It was about 
			as popular as a root canal.</p>
		</font>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">But when I 
		ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular -- I 
		would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the 
		financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More 
		businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely 
		been lost. So I 
		supported the last Administration's efforts to create the financial 
		rescue program. And when we took the program over, we made it more 
		transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now 
		stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the 
		banks.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Most, but 
		not all. To recover 
		the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now -- 
		Now, I know Wall Street 
		isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big 
		bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers 
		who rescued them in their time of need.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, as we 
		stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy 
		growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had 
		become unemployed. That's why 
		we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million 
		Americans, made health insurance 65% cheaper for families who get their 
		coverage through 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1985">
		<font color="#0000FF">COBRA</font></a>, and passed 25 different tax cuts.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, let me 
		repeat: We cut taxes.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We cut taxes for 95% of working families.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We cut 
		taxes for small businesses.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We 
		cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We cut taxes 
		for eight million Americans paying for college.</p>
		</font>
			<font face="Verdana" size="1">
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamasouwecuttaxes.JPG" width="128" height="176"> 
		</font>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		(I thought 
		I'd get some applause on that one.)</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">As a result 
		-- As a result, millions of 
		Americans had more to spend on gas, and food, and other necessities -- all 
		of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised 
		income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not a single dime.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, because of 
		the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right 
		now who would otherwise be unemployed. 200,000 work in construction and 
		clean energy. 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of 
		thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first 
		responders. And we're on track to add another one and a half million 
		jobs to this total by the end of the year.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">The plan 
		that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is 
		the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009">
		<font color="#0000FF">Recovery Act</font></a>. That's right: the Recovery Act, also known as the 
		Stimulus Bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has 
		helped saved jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their 
		word for it: Talk to 
		the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of 
		the Recovery Act. Talk to 
		the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical 
		about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just 
		because of the business it created. Talk to 
		the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the 
		last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be 
		laid off after all.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">There are 
		stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, 
		the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back 
		some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and 
		slowly [some] are starting to hire again.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">But I 
		realize that for every success story, there are other stories -- of men 
		and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next 
		paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear 
		nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 
		2010. And that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, the 
		true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's 
		businesses. (I agree. Absolutely). But government can create the conditions necessary for 
		businesses to expand and hire more workers. We should 
		start where most new jobs do -- in small businesses, companies that begin 
		when -- companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an 
		entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides its 
		time she became her own boss.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Through 
		sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the 
		recession and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small business 
		owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania or Elyria, Ohio, you find 
		out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're 
		mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for 
		small business owners across the country -- even those that are making a 
		profit.</p>
		</font>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2" /p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">So 
		tonight, I'm proposing that we take 30 billion dollars of the money Wall Street 
		banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small 
		businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a 
		new small business tax credit -- one that will go to over one million 
		small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, 
		let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business 
		investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all 
		small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Next, we 
		can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. 
		From -- From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation 
		has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China 
		should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture 
		clean energy products.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Tomorrow, 
		I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new 
		high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like 
		that all across this country that will create jobs and help our  
		move our nation's goods, services, and information. We should put more Americans to 
		work building clean energy facilities, and give -- and give rebates to Americans who 
		make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy 
		jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our 
		borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that 
		ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that 
		create jobs right here in the United States of America.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, the House 
		has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first 
		order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same -- and I 
		know they will. They will. People 
		are out of work. They're hurting. And they need our help. And I want a jobs 
		bill on my desk without delay.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">But -- But the 
		truth is, these steps still won't make up for the seven million jobs 
		that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full 
		employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and 
		finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for 
		years.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We can't 
		afford another so-called economic &quot;expansion&quot; like the one from 
		the last 
		decade -- what some call the &quot;lost decade&quot; -- where jobs grew more slowly 
		than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average 
		American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition 
		reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and 
		financial speculation.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">From the 
		day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger 
		challenges is too ambitious. Such an effort would be too 
		contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we 
		should just put things on hold for awhile. For those 
		who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long 
		should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">You see -- 
		You see, 
		Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems 
		have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy. 
		Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations are -- they're 
		not 
		standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're 
		putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their 
		infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy 
		because they want those jobs.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Well, I do 
		not accept second-place for the United States of America.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">As hard as it 
		may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's 
		time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our 
		growth. Now, one place 
		to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in 
		punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, 
		healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access 
		credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into 
		investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard 
		against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire 
		economy.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We need to 
		make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they 
		need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, 
		including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the 
		whole economy. Now, the House 
		has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And -- 
		And the 
		lobbyists are trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win 
		this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the 
		test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've 
		got to get it right.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Next, we 
		need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest 
		investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an 
		investment that 
		could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills 
		cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe 
		for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's 
		investment in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will 
		create 1200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries, or, in 
		the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar 
		panels.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">But to 
		create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more 
		efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of 
		safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough 
		decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal 
		technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and 
		climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the 
		profitable kind of energy in America.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">I am 
		grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. And this year 
		-- this year, I am 
		eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. I know there 
		have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough 
		economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the 
		overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But -- But -- Here 
		-- Here's the thing: Even if you 
		doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean 
		energy are the right thing to do for our future because the nation 
		that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the 
		global economy. And America must be that nation.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Third, we 
		need to export more of our goods -- because the more products we make and 
		sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. 
		So -- So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 
		five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. 
		To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative 
		that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and 
		reform export controls consistent with national security.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">We have to 
		seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America 
		sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose 
		the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits 
		also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by 
		the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement 
		that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade 
		relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama 
		and Colombia.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Fourth, we 
		need to invest in the skills and education of our people.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal" align="left">Now, this year 
		-- this year 
		we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching 
		a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: 
		instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding 
		the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student 
		achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns 
		around failing schools that steal the future of too many young 
		Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, 
		the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education. And in 
		this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where 
		they live than on their potential.

		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_and_Secondary_Education_Act">
		<font color="#0000FF">Elementary and Secondary Education Act</font></a>, 
		we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states. 
		Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a 
		good job.&nbsp;That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a 
		bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career 
		pathway to the children of so many working families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To make college more 
		affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer 
		subsidies that go to banks for student loans.&nbsp;Instead, let's take that 
		money and give families a 10,000 dollar tax credit for four years of 
		college and increase Pell Grants.&nbsp;And let's tell another one million 
		students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 
		percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be 
		forgiven after 20 years -- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a 
		career in public service, because in the United States of America, no 
		one should go broke because they chose to go to college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, it's time 
		for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own 
		costs -- because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this 
		problem.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2" /p>
		Now, the 
		price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the 
		middle-class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair 
		a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/strongmiddleclass/about">
		<font color="#0000FF">task force on Middle-Class Families</font></a>. That's why we're nearly doubling 
		the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement 
		by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the 
		tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to 
		lift the value of a family's single largest investment -- their home. The 
		steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed 
		millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of 
		1500 dollars on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up re-financing so 
		that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And -- And it is 
		precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still 
		need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let's clear a few 
		things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative 
		victory under my belt.&nbsp;And by now it should be fairly obvious that I 
		didn't take on health care because it was good politics.&nbsp;I took on 
		health care because [of] the stories I've heard from Americans with 
		preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients 
		who've been denied coverage; families -- even those with insurance -- 
		who are just one illness away from financial ruin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After nearly a century of 
		trying -- Democratic Administrations, Republican Administrations -- we 
		are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many 
		Americans.&nbsp;The approach we've taken would protect every American from 
		the worst practices of the insurance industry.&nbsp;It would give small 
		businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable 
		health care plan in a competitive market.&nbsp;It would require every 
		insurance plan to cover preventive care.&nbsp;And by the way, I want to 
		acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a 
		national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make 
		kids healthier. Thank you.&nbsp;She gets embarrassed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our approach would preserve 
		the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their 
		plan.&nbsp;It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and 
		businesses.&nbsp;And according to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">
		<font color="#0000FF">Congressional Budget Office</font></a> -- the 
		independent organization that both parties have cited as the official 
		scorekeeper for Congress -- our approach would bring down the deficit by 
		as much as one trillion dollars over the next two decades.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still, this is a complexed 
		issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. 
		I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the 
		American people.&nbsp;And I know that with all the lobbying and 
		horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, &quot;What's in it 
		for me?&quot; But I also know this problem 
		is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more 
		Americans will have lost their health insurance.&nbsp;Millions will lose it 
		this year.&nbsp;Our deficit will grow.&nbsp;Premiums will go up.&nbsp;Patients will be 
		denied the care they need.&nbsp;Small business owners will continue to drop 
		coverage altogether.&nbsp;I will not walk away from these Americans, and 
		neither should the people in this chamber.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, as temperatures cool, I 
		want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's 
		a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our 
		system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status 
		quo.&nbsp;But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will 
		bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, 
		strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let 
		me know.&nbsp;Let me know.&nbsp;Let me know.&nbsp;I'm eager to see it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here's what I ask Congress, 
		though:&nbsp;Don't walk away from reform.&nbsp;Not now.&nbsp;Not when we are so 
		close.&nbsp;Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the 
		American people.&nbsp;Let's get it done.&nbsp;Let's get it done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even as health care 
		reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a 
		massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves.&nbsp;It's a challenge that 
		makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that's been subject 
		to a lot of political posturing.&nbsp;So let me start the discussion of 
		government spending by setting the record straight.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the beginning of the last 
		decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over 200 
		billion dollars.&nbsp;By -- By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over 
		one 
		trillion dollars and projected deficits of eight trillion dollars over the next 
		decade.&nbsp;Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax 
		cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the 
		effects of the recession put a three trillion dollar hole in our budget. All this 
		was before I walked in the door.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now -- Now -- just stating the 
		facts.&nbsp;Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked 
		nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.&nbsp;But we took office 
		amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added 
		another one trillion dollars to our national debt.&nbsp;That, too, is a fact.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm absolutely convinced 
		that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are 
		tightening their belts and making tough decisions.&nbsp;The federal 
		government should do the same.&nbsp; So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps 
		to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last 
		year. Starting in 2011, we are 
		prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related 
		to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will 
		not be affected.&nbsp; But all other discretionary government programs will. 
		Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in 
		what we need and sacrifice what we don't.&nbsp;And if I have to enforce this 
		discipline by veto, I will.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will continue to go 
		through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs 
		that we can't afford and don't work.&nbsp;We've already identified 20 
		billion dollars in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend 
		our middle-class tax cuts.&nbsp;But at a time of record deficits, we will not 
		continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and 
		for those making over 250,000 dollars a year.&nbsp;We just can't afford it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even after paying for 
		what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had 
		when I took office.&nbsp;More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, 
		and Social Security will continue to skyrocket.&nbsp;That's why I've called 
		for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Gregg"><font color="#0000FF">Judd Gregg</font></a> and Democrat 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Conrad">
		<font color="#0000FF">Kent Conrad</font></a>.&nbsp;This can't be one of those 
		Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem.&nbsp;The 
		commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain 
		deadline.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, yesterday the 
		<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jan/27/senate-nixes-panel-on-deficit-and-debt/">
		<font color="#0000FF">Senate 
		blocked a bill</font></a> that would have created this commission.&nbsp;So I'll issue an
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)">
		<font color="#0000FF">executive order</font></a> that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to 
		pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.&nbsp;And when the 
		vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAYGO"><font color="#0000FF">pay-as-you-go law</font></a> 
		that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that some in my 
		own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze 
		government spending when so many are still hurting.&nbsp;And I agree -- which 
		is why this freeze won't take effect until next year -- when the economy 
		is stronger.&nbsp;That's how budgeting works.&nbsp;But understand -- understand 
		if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage 
		our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery 
		-- all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and 
		family incomes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From some on the right, I 
		expect we'll hear a different argument -- that if we just make fewer 
		investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the 
		wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo 
		on health care, our deficits will go away.&nbsp;The problem is that's what we 
		did for eight years.&nbsp;That's what helped us into this crisis.&nbsp;It's what 
		helped lead to these deficits.&nbsp;We can't do it again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than fight the same 
		tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to 
		try something new.&nbsp;Let's invest in our people without leaving them a 
		mountain of debt.&nbsp;Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent 
		us here.&nbsp;Let's try common sense -- a novel concept.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to do that we have to 
		recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now.&nbsp;We 
		face a deficit of trust -- deep and corrosive doubts about how 
		Washington works that have been growing for years.&nbsp;To close that 
		credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania 
		Avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work 
		openly; to give our people the government they deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that's what I came to 
		Washington to do.&nbsp;That's why, for the first time in history, my Administration posts on our </font>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2" /p>
		<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records">
		<font color="#0000FF">White House visitors online</font></a></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">. 
		That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on 
		federal boards and commissions. But we can't stop 
		there.&nbsp;It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make 
		on behalf of a client with my Administration or with Congress.&nbsp;It's time 
		to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to 
		candidates for federal office.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With all due deference to 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers">

		</font>
		</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">that I believe will open the 
		floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to 
		spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections 
		should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests -- or worse, by 
		foreign entities.&nbsp;They should be decided by the American people.&nbsp;And I'd 
		urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some 
		of these problems.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm also calling on Congress 
		to continue down the path of earmark reform -- Democrats and 
		Republicans, Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;Look...you've trimmed some of this 
		spending; you've embraced some meaningful change.&nbsp;But restoring the 
		public trust demands more.&nbsp;For example, some members of Congress post 
		some earmark requests online. Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to 
		publish all <a href="http://earmarks.omb.gov/"><font color="#0000FF">earmark requests</font></a> on a single Web site before there's a vote, 
		so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, none of these 
		reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one 
		another.&nbsp;Now, I'm not naïve.&nbsp;I never thought that the mere fact of my 
		election would usher in peace and harmony, and some post-partisan 
		era.&nbsp;I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply 
		entrenched.&nbsp;And on some issues, there are simply philosophical 
		differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, 
		about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities 
		and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 
		years. They're the very essence of our democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what frustrates the 
		American people is a Washington where every day is &quot;Election Day.&quot;&nbsp;We 
		can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can 
		get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -- a belief 
		that if you lose, I win.<sup><font color="#FF0000">1</font></sup>&nbsp;Neither party should delay or obstruct every 
		single bill just because they can. The confirmation of -- I'm speaking 
		to both parties now -- the confirmation of well-qualified public servants 
		shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few 
		individual senators.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Washington may think that 
		saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how 
		malicious, is just part of the game.&nbsp;But it's precisely such politics 
		that has stopped either party from helping the American people.&nbsp;Worse 
		yet -- Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust 
		in our government.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, no, I will not give up 
		on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election 
		year.&nbsp; And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even 
		earlier than usual.&nbsp;But we still need to govern.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Democrats, I would remind 
		you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people 
		expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.&nbsp;And if the 
		Republican leadership is going to insist that -- that 60 votes in the Senate are 
		required to do any business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- 
		then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well.&nbsp;Just saying no 
		to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership.&nbsp;We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let's 
		show the American people that we can do it together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This week -- This week, I'll be 
		meet -- addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly 
		meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you 
		can't wait.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, throughout our history, no 
		issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the 
		unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated.&nbsp;Now, we can argue all we want about 
		who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the 
		past. I know that all of us love this country.&nbsp;All of us are committed 
		to its defense.&nbsp;So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who 
		is 
		tough.&nbsp;Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and 
		upholding our values.&nbsp;Let's leave behind the fear and division, and do 
		what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- 
		for America and for the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the work we began 
		last year.&nbsp;Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the 
		terrorists who threaten our nation.&nbsp;We've made substantial investments 
		in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take 
		American lives.&nbsp;We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed 
		Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our 
		intelligence.&nbsp;We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships 
		from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp;And in the last 
		year, hundreds of al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many 
		senior leaders, have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in Afghanistan, we're 
		increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can 
		begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come 
		home.&nbsp;We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and 
		support the rights of all Afghans -- men and women alike. We're joined 
		by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who 
		will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common 
		purpose.&nbsp;There will be difficult days ahead.&nbsp;But I am absolutely 
		confident we will succeed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we take the fight to al 
		Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people.&nbsp;As a candidate, I 
		promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as 
		President.&nbsp;We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end 
		of this August. We will support -- We will support the Iraqi government -- 
		We will support 
		the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to 
		partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and 
		prosperity.&nbsp;But make no mistake:&nbsp;This war is ending, and all of our 
		troops are coming home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight, all of our men and 
		women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world -- 
		they have to know that we -- that...they have our respect, our gratitude, 
		our full support.&nbsp;And just as they must have the resources they need in 
		war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come 
		home.&nbsp;That's why we made the largest increase in investments for 
		veterans in decades last year.&nbsp;That's why we're building a 21st 
		century VA.&nbsp;And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge 
		a national <a href="../michelleobamacelebratingmilitarywomen.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">commitment to support military families</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even as we prosecute 
		two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the 
		American people -- the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the 
		vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that 
		reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To 
		reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the 
		United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the 
		farthest-reachings arms control treaty in nearly two decades.&nbsp;And at 
		April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here 
		in Washington, D.C. behind a clear goal:&nbsp;securing all vulnerable nuclear 
		materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into 
		the hands of terrorists.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, these diplomatic 
		efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations 
		that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear 
		weapons.&nbsp;That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and 
		stronger sanctions -- sanctions that are being vigorously 
		enforced.&nbsp;That's why the international community is more united and the 
		Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated.&nbsp;And as Iran's leaders 
		continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt:&nbsp;They, 
		too, will face growing consequences.&nbsp;That is a promise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the leadership that 
		we are providing -- engagement that advances the common security and 
		prosperity of all people. We're working through the G20 to sustain a 
		lasting global recovery.&nbsp; We're working with Muslim communities around 
		the world to promote science and education and innovation. We have gone 
		from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're 
		helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the 
		fight against HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;And we are launching a new initiative that will 
		give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to 
		bioterrorism or an infectious disease -- a plan that will counter 
		threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we have for over 60 
		years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to 
		those beyond our shores.&nbsp;But we also do it because it is right.&nbsp;That's 
		why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with 
		many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild.&nbsp;That's why 
		we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; why we 
		support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of 
		Iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in 
		Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human 
		dignity. Always.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abroad, America's greatest 
		source of strength has always been our ideals.&nbsp;The same is true at 
		home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise 
		enshrined in our Constitution:&nbsp;the notion that we're all created equal; 
		that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the 
		law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values 
		you should be treated no different than anyone else.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must continually renew 
		this promise. My Administration has a 
		<a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/"><font color="#0000FF">Civil Rights 
		Division</font></a> that is once 
		again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment 
		discrimination.&nbsp;We finally strengthened -- We finally strengthened our laws to protect against 
		crimes driven by hate.&nbsp;This year -- This year, I will work with Congress and our 
		military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right 
		to serve the country they love because of who they are.&nbsp;It's the right 
		thing to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're going to crack down on 
		violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal 
		day's work.&nbsp;And we should continue the work of fixing our broken 
		immigration system -- to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and 
		ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our 
		economy and enrich our nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, it's our ideals, 
		our values that built America -- values that allowed us to forge a 
		nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that 
		drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their 
		responsibilities to their families and their employers.&nbsp;Time and again, 
		they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country.&nbsp;They 
		take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit.&nbsp;These aren't 
		Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by; business 
		values or labor values.&nbsp;They're American values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, too many of 
		our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our 
		corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these 
		same values.&nbsp;Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and 
		women doing important work that helps our country prosper.&nbsp;But each time 
		a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at 
		risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists 
		game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting 
		this country up, we lose faith.&nbsp;The more that TV pundits reduce serious 
		debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens 
		turn away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No wonder there's so much 
		cynicism out there.&nbsp;No wonder there's so much disappointment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I campaigned on the promise 
		of change -- &quot;Change we can believe in&quot; -- the slogan went.&nbsp;And right 
		now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still 
		believe we can change -- or that I can deliver it. But remember this -- I never 
		suggested that change would be easy, or that I could do it alone.&nbsp;Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and 
		complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it 
		stirs passions and controversy.&nbsp;That's just how it is.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those of us in public office 
		can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard 
		truths and pointing fingers.&nbsp;We can do what's necessary to keep our 
		poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing 
		what's best for the next generation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I also know this:&nbsp;If 
		people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 
		years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is 
		because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to 
		do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took 
		to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their 
		grandchildren.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Administration has had 
		some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But 
		I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the 
		setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.&nbsp;And what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is that despite all 
		these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that 
		fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American 
		people -- that lives on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It lives on in the 
		struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company: &quot;None of 
		us,&quot; he said, &quot;are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might 
		fail.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It lives on in the woman who 
		said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of 
		recession, &quot;We are strong.&nbsp;We are resilient. We are American.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It lives on in the 
		8-year-old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if 
		I would give it to the people of Haiti.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it lives on in all the 
		Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been 
		and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of 
		&quot;U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!&quot; when another life was saved.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The spirit that has 
		sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its 
		people.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have finished a difficult year.&nbsp;We have come through a 
		difficult decade.&nbsp;But a new year has come.&nbsp;A new decade stretches before 
		us.&nbsp;We don't quit.&nbsp;I don't quit. Let's seize this moment -- to start 
		anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp;God bless you. 
		And God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
