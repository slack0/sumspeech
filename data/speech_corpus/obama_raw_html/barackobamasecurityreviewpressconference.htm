		<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, 
		including those from our intelligence, homeland security and law 
		enforcement agencies involved in the security reviews that I ordered 
		after the failed attack on Christmas Day.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
		I called these leaders to the White House because we face a 
		challenge of the utmost urgency.&nbsp;As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda 
		and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in their efforts to kill 
		Americans.&nbsp; And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, 
		but to disrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, over the past year, we've taken the fight to al Qaeda and 
		its allies wherever they plot and train, be it in Afghanistan and 
		Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countries around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here at home, our 
		intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have worked 
		together with considerable success:&nbsp;gathering intelligence, stitching 
		it together, and making arrests -- from Denver to Texas, from Illinois 
		to New York -- disrupting plots and saving American lives.&nbsp; And these 
		successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week in the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Chapman_attack">
		<font color="#0000FF">loss 
		of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan</font></a>.<br>
		&nbsp; <br>
		But when a 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab">
		<font color="#0000FF">suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with 
		explosives on Christmas Day</font></a> the system has failed in a potentially 
		disastrous way.&nbsp; And it's my responsibility to find out why, and to 
		correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's why, shortly 
		after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews.&nbsp; I 
		directed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review 
		aviation screening, technology and procedures.&nbsp; She briefed me on her 
		initial findings today, and I'm pleased that this review is drawing on 
		the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretary of 
		Energy Steven Chu and his department.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security advisor 
		John Brennan to lead a 
		<a href="../johnbrennanbriefingon12-25-09attack.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">thorough review into our terrorist watch-listing 
		system</font></a> so we can fix what went wrong.&nbsp; As we discussed today, this 
		ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemic 
		failures that almost cost nearly 300 lives.&nbsp; We will make a 
		<a href="whitehousereviewattack12-25-09.htm"><font color="#0000FF">summary of 
		this preliminary report</font></a> public within the next few days, but let me 
		share some of what we know so far.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As I described over the 
		weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Farouk_Abdulmutallab">
		<font color="#0000FF">Umar Farouk 
		Abdulmutallab</font></a> had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists 
		there.&nbsp; It now turns out that our intelligence community knew of other 
		red flags -- that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to strike not 
		only American targets in Yemen, but the United States itself.&nbsp; And we 
		had information that this group was working with an individual who was 
		known -- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the 
		Christmas attack.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bottom line is 
		this:&nbsp; The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered 
		this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack.&nbsp; But our 
		intelligence community failed to connect those dots, which would have 
		placed the suspect on the &quot;no fly&quot; list.
		In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence; it was a 
		failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already 
		had.&nbsp; The information was there.&nbsp; Agencies and analysts who needed it 
		had access to it.&nbsp; And our professionals were trained to look for it and 
		to bring it all together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I will accept that 
		intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear 
		that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged.&nbsp; That's not 
		acceptable, and I will not tolerate it.&nbsp; Time and again, we've learned 
		that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is 
		critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So we have to do better 
		-- and we will do better.&nbsp; And we have to do it quickly.&nbsp; American lives 
		are on the line.&nbsp; So I made it clear today to my team:&nbsp; I want our 
		initial reviews completed this week.&nbsp; I want specific recommendations 
		for corrective actions to fix what went wrong.&nbsp; I want those reforms 
		implemented immediately, so that this doesn't happen again and so we can 
		prevent future attacks.&nbsp; And I know that every member of my team that I 
		met with today understands the urgency of getting this right.&nbsp; And I 
		appreciate that each of them took responsibility for the shortfalls 
		within their own agencies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Immediately after the 
		attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people:&nbsp; new 
		screening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more 
		explosive detection teams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and 
		deepening cooperation with international partners.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In recent days, we've taken additional steps to improve security.&nbsp; 
		Counterterrorism officials have reviewed and updated our terrorist watch 
		list system, including adding more individuals to the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Fly_List">
		<font color="#0000FF">&quot;no fly&quot; list</font></a>.&nbsp; 
		And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is not 
		broken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the &quot;no fly&quot; list shows that 
		this system needs to be strengthened.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The State Department is 
		now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visa 
		information in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected 
		terrorist connections.&nbsp; As of yesterday, the Transportation Security 
		Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhanced screening for passengers 
		flying into the United States from, or flying through, nations on our 
		list of state sponsors of terrorism, or other countries of interest.&nbsp; 
		And in the days ahead, I will announce further steps to disrupt attacks, 
		including better integration of information and enhanced passenger 
		screening for air travel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, some have 
		suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit 
		the decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.&nbsp; So let me be 
		clear.&nbsp; It was always our intent to transfer detainees to other 
		countries only under conditions that provide assurances that our 
		security is being protected.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With respect to Yemen 
		in particular, there's an ongoing security situation which we have been 
		confronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner.&nbsp; Given the 
		unsettled situation, I've spoken to the Attorney General and we've 
		agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to 
		Yemen at this time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But make no mistake:&nbsp; 
		We will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security 
		interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda.&nbsp; In 
		fact, that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in 
		the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp; And, as I've always said, we will do so -- we 
		will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safe 
		and secure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our reviews -- and the steps 
		that we've taken and will continue to take -- go to the heart of the 
		kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century.&nbsp; 
		Just as al Qaeda and its allies are constantly evolving and adapting 
		their efforts to strike us, we have to constantly adapt and evolve to 
		defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin for error is 
		slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As these violent 
		extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever they 
		take root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are 
		doing currently with the government in Yemen.&nbsp; As our adversaries seek 
		new recruits, we'll constantly review and rapidly update our 
		intelligence and our institutions.&nbsp; As they refine our tactics, we'll 
		enhance our defenses, including smarter screening and security at 
		airports, and investing in the technologies that might have detected the 
		kind of explosives used on Christmas.<br>
		&nbsp; <br>
		In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law 
		enforcement systems -- and the people in them -- to be accountable and 
		to work as intended:&nbsp; collecting, sharing, integrating, analyzing, and 
		acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save 
		innocent lives -- not just most of the time, but all the time.&nbsp; That's 
		what the American people deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As President, that's exactly what I 
		will demand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much.</font></p>
