			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, to President DeGioia, thank 
			you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing 
			your family -- including JT -- appreciate you. We're going to invite 
			him over, hang out with the girls. He's a pretty 
			good-looking young man.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Mayor Adrian Fenty, 
			who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for 
			your attendance. To Representative Donna Edwards, who is 
			here and represents Maryland's 4th District, thank you.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Georgetown University 
			students, it is great to be here. Well, it is good to be 
			back. I appeared in this room during the campaign and had a 
			wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with 
			all of you.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're going to talk 
			about the economy today. And I was telling President DeGioia this 
			may be a slightly longer speech than I usually give, but it's a 
			slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with so 
			many of our economic challenges.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, it's been 12 
			weeks now since my administration began. And I think that even our 
			critics would agree that at the very least, we've been busy. 
			In just under three months, we've responded to an 
			extraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action 
			-- action that's been unprecedented both in terms of its scale and 
			its speed.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I know that some 
			have accused us of taking on too much at once. Others believe we 
			haven't done enough. And many Americans are simply wondering how all 
			of our different programs and policies fit together in a single, 
			overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to 
			recovery and ultimately to prosperity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I want to step 
			back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as I can. This 
			is going to be prose, and not poetry. I want to talk about what 
			we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do. I want 
			to update you on the progress we've made, but I also want to be 
			honest about the pitfalls that may still lie ahead.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of all, I want 
			every American to know that each action we take and each policy we 
			pursue is driven by a larger vision of America's future -- a future 
			where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising 
			incomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, 
			or reckless speculation, or fleeting profits, but is instead built 
			by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will 
			spread opportunity at home and allow this nation to lead the world 
			in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries that will 
			shape the 21st century. That's the America I see. That's the America 
			that Georgetown is preparing so many of you for. That is the future 
			that I know that we can have.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to understand how 
			we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recessions are not 
			uncommon. Markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've 
			seen many times in our history. But this recession is different. 
			This recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business 
			cycle. It was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor 
			decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to 
			Main Street.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As has been widely 
			reported, it started in the housing market. During the course of the 
			decade, the formula for buying a house changed: Instead of saving 
			their pennies to buy their dream house, many Americans found that 
			suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards 
			their incomes just could not support. Others were tricked into 
			signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a 
			quick profit. The reason these loans were so readily available was 
			that Wall Street saw big profits to be made. Investment banks would 
			buy and package together these questionable mortgages into 
			securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had 
			somehow been reduced. And credit agencies that are supposed to help 
			investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the 
			securities with their safest rating when they should have been 
			labeled &quot;Buyer Beware.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No one really knew what 
			the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood 
			what the risks were. But since the housing market was booming and 
			prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling 
			them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater 
			profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility. 
			Banks took on more debt than they could handle.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The government-chartered 
			companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose traditional mandate was 
			to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the 
			action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these 
			securities. AIG, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very 
			traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to 
			make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated 
			financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities. 
			Everybody was making record profits -- except the wealth created was 
			real only on paper. And as the bubble grew, there was almost no 
			accountability or oversight from anyone in Washington.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the housing bubble 
			burst. Home prices fell. People began to default on their subprime 
			mortgages. And the value of all those loans and securities 
			plummeted. Banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them. 
			Greed gave way to fear. Investors pulled their money out of the 
			market. Large financial institutions that didn't have enough money 
			on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed. Other banks held 
			on tight to their money and simply stopped lending.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this is when the 
			crisis spread from Wall Street to Main Street. After all, the 
			ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything 
			from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college 
			education. It's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy 
			equipment, and businesses make payroll. So when banks stopped 
			lending money, businesses started laying off workers. When laid-off 
			workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off 
			even more workers. When people couldn't get a car loan, a bad 
			situation at the auto companies became even worse. When people 
			couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only 
			deepened. Because the infected securities were being traded 
			worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this 
			recession soon became global. And when other nations can't afford to 
			buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is the 
			situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we 
			took office. So our most urgent task has been to clear away the 
			wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do 
			everything we can to prevent a larger collapse. And since the 
			problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious 
			economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of 
			our economic crisis simultaneously.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first step was to 
			fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy. So the Federal 
			Reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year 
			in order to boost investment. My administration and Congress boosted 
			demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history. 
			It's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3.5 
			million jobs over the next two years. It's putting money directly 
			into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working 
			families that's now showing up in paychecks across America. And to 
			cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended 
			unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to 
			Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, you will recall 
			that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible 
			government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term 
			deficit projections, and that the federal government should be 
			cutting instead of increasing spending right now. So I want to 
			tackle this argument head on.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To begin with, 
			economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing 
			a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back 
			on spending. You see, when this recession began, many families sat 
			around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could 
			cut back. And so have many businesses. And this is a completely 
			reasonable and understandable reaction. But if everybody -- if 
			everybody -- if every family in America, if every business in 
			America cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, 
			which means there are no customers, which means there are more 
			layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse. That's why the 
			government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to 
			stimulate demand. That's exactly what we're doing right now.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, I absolutely 
			agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to 
			fix. But the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny 
			fraction of that long-term deficit. As I'll discuss in a moment, the 
			key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is 
			to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs -- not to stand 
			idly by as the economy goes into free fall.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the recovery plan has 
			been the first step in confronting this economic crisis. The second 
			step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once 
			again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The heart of this 
			financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial 
			institutions simply stopped lending money. In a climate of fear, 
			banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad 
			mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were 
			unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid 
			that no one would pay it back. It's for this reason that the last 
			administration used what they called the Troubled Asset Relief 
			Program, or TARP, to provide these banks with temporary financial 
			assistance in order to get them lending again.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I understand that 
			TARP is not popular, and I have to say that I don't agree with some 
			of the ways the TARP program was managed, but I do agree with the 
			broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and 
			the confidence necessary to start lending again. That's the purpose 
			of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional 
			capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks. 
			Ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are 
			willing to put in money to these banks. But where that's not 
			possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from 
			the government, then we will hold accountable those who are 
			responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide 
			the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will 
			assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can 
			serve our people and our economy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there are 
			some who differ with our approach. On the one hand, there are some 
			who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these 
			banks fail -- especially since in many cases it was their bad 
			decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place. But 
			whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when 
			nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit 
			flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of 
			months and months -- years of low growth, years of low job creation, 
			years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more 
			than a course of bold, upfront action.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And although there are a 
			lot of Americans who understandably think that government money 
			would be better spent going directly to families and businesses 
			instead of to banks -- one of my most frequent questions in the 
			letters that I get from constituents is, &quot;Where's my bailout?&quot; -- 
			and I understand the sentiment. It makes sense intuitively, and 
			morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in 
			a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and 
			businesses. So that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead 
			to a faster pace of economic growth. That's why we have to fix the 
			banks.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, on the other hand, 
			there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the 
			banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we 
			go about it. This is essentially the nationalization argument that 
			some of you may have heard. And the argument says that the federal 
			government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken 
			over major financial institutions the way that the FDIC currently 
			intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my 
			administration's failure to do so is yet another example of 
			Washington coddling Wall Street -- &quot;Why aren't you tougher on the 
			banks?&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me be clear: The 
			reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any 
			ideological or political judgment we've made about government 
			involvement in banks. It's certainly not because of any concern we 
			have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to 
			cause this mess. Rather, it's because we believe that preemptive 
			government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even 
			more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than 
			create confidence.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Governments should 
			practice the same principle as doctors: First, do no harm. So rest 
			assured -- we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing 
			again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers 
			and to the broader economy. To that end, in addition to the program 
			to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will 
			pair government resources with private investment in order to clear 
			away the old loans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- 
			that are also preventing our banks from lending money.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, what we've also 
			learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only 
			institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the 
			financial system. AIG, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance 
			company, as I mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure 
			billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a 
			hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could 
			threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more. 
			And that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and I promise you, nobody 
			is more frustrated than me with AIG -- I promise -- we 
			had to provide support for AIG, because the entire system, as 
			fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if AIG went into a 
			liquidation bankruptcy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's also why we need 
			new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such 
			financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts 
			currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose 
			systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses 
			in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system 
			-- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus 
			contracts without creating a perception the government can just 
			change compensation rules on a whim.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is also why we're 
			moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending 
			outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in 
			America actually takes place. To do this, we've started a program 
			that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock 
			the market for auto loans and student loans. And to stabilize the 
			housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four 
			million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many 
			millions more to refinance their homes.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a few weeks, we will 
			also reassess the state of Chrysler and General Motors, two 
			companies with an important place in our history and a large 
			footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallen 
			on hard times.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Late last year, the 
			companies were given transitional loans by the previous 
			administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable 
			business plans. Unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, 
			so we've given them some additional time to work these complex 
			issues through. And by the way, we owed that not to the executives 
			whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but 
			to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in 
			the balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states are 
			profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, it is our fervent 
			hope that in the coming weeks, Chrysler will find a viable partner 
			and GM will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to 
			profitability without endless support from American taxpayer. In the 
			meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for American cars and 
			provide relief for autoworkers and their communities. And we will 
			continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century 
			American auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the 
			fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a 
			clean-energy future.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, to coordinate a 
			global response to this global recession, I went to the meeting of 
			the G20 nations in London the other week. Each nation has undertaken 
			significant stimulus to spur demand. All agreed to pursue tougher 
			regulatory reforms. We also agreed to triple the lending capacity of 
			the International Monetary Fund -- which, as many of you know, is an 
			international financial institution supported by all the major 
			economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to 
			developing nations and vulnerable populations. That's not just 
			charity; because America's success depends on whether other nations 
			have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay 
			attention to these emerging markets.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We pledged to avoid the 
			trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end. And 
			we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take 
			additional steps if necessary.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that's where we've 
			been, that's what we've done in the last three months. All of these 
			actions -- the Recovery Act, the bank capitalization program, the 
			housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the 
			auto plan, and our work at the G20 -- all have been necessary pieces 
			of the recovery puzzle. They've been designed to increase aggregate 
			demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to 
			help families and businesses ride out the storm. And taken together, 
			these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because of our recovery 
			plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; 
			clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring 
			workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new 
			roads and highways. Our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in 
			the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of 
			historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like 
			putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket. Our program to support the 
			market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this 
			market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks. 
			And small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the 
			first time in months.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this is all welcome 
			and encouraging news. It does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 
			will continue to be a difficult year for America's economy, and 
			obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs. The 
			severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more 
			foreclosures, and more pain before it ends. The market will continue 
			to rise and fall. Credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it 
			should. The process for restructuring AIG and the auto companies 
			will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices; we are not 
			finished yet on that front. And all of this means that there's much 
			more work to be done. But all of this also means that you can 
			continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort 
			from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all 
			fronts.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even as we continue 
			to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is 
			my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure 
			such a crisis never happens again. Even as we clean up 
			balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start 
			spending and businesses start hiring -- all that's going to happen 
			-- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust 
			economy that led us to this point.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is simply not 
			sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed 
			by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness 
			of a few to threaten the entire economy. It is not sustainable to 
			have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate 
			profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home 
			prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued 
			assets. It's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of 
			the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working 
			household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000. That's 
			just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For even as too many 
			were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits 
			over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats 
			to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the rising cost of 
			health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of 
			our education system to prepare our workers for a new age; the 
			progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries 
			and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the 
			growing debt that we're passing on to our children. Even after we 
			emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still 
			represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in 
			the 21st century. So we've got a lot of work to do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there's a parable 
			at the end of the Sermon on the Mount that tells the story of two 
			men. The first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon 
			destroyed when a storm hit. But the second is known as the wise man, 
			for when &quot;the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds 
			blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not: for it was founded upon 
			a rock.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was founded upon a 
			rock. We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We 
			must build our house upon a rock. We must lay a new foundation for 
			growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era 
			of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we 
			consume less at home and send more exports abroad.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a foundation built 
			upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new 
			century another American century: Number one, new rules for Wall 
			Street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless 
			risk-taking; number two, new investments in education 
			that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and 
			technology that will create new jobs and new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will 
			cut costs for families and businesses; and number five, new savings 
			in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future 
			generations.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the new 
			foundation we must build. That's our house built upon a rock. That 
			must be our future -- and my administration's policies are designed 
			to achieve that future.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me talk about each 
			of these steps in turn. The first step we will take to build this 
			foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that 
			allowed this crisis to happen in the first place. It is time to lay 
			down tough new rules of the road for Wall Street to ensure that we 
			never find ourselves here again. Just as after the Great Depression 
			new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless 
			speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to 
			make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that 
			punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their 
			actual job performance --- a novel concept; rules that 
			protect typical American families when they buy a home, get a credit 
			card or invest in a 401(k). So we've already begun to work with 
			Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework -- and 
			I expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the 
			year is out.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second pillar of 
			this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our 
			workers for a 21st century economy. You know, in the 20th century, 
			the G.I. Bill helped send a generation to college. For decades we 
			led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led 
			the world in economic growth. But in this new economy, we've come to 
			trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational 
			achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers. That's 
			why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to 
			compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: By 
			2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college 
			graduates in the world. That is the goal that we have set and we 
			intend to do.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To meet that goal, we 
			have to start early. So we've already dramatically expanded early 
			childhood education. We are investing in innovative 
			programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and 
			close achievement gaps. We're creating new rewards that tie 
			teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement. And I've 
			asked every American to commit to at least one year or more of 
			higher education or career training, and we have provided tax 
			credits to make a college education more affordable for every 
			American, even those who attend Georgetown.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, by the way, one of 
			the changes that I would like to see -- and I'm going to be talking 
			about this in weeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our 
			brightest commit themselves to making things -- engineers, 
			scientists, innovators. For so long, we have placed at 
			the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage 
			in complex financial calculations. And that's good, we need some of 
			that. But you know what we can really use is some more 
			scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making 
			things that we can export to other countries.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the third pillar of 
			this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can 
			create millions of new jobs and new industries. We all know that the 
			country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st 
			century. Yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this 
			race to the future. I don't know about you, but I do not accept a 
			future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond 
			our borders. I think it's time for America to lead again.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the investments we 
			made in the Recovery Act will double this nation's supply of 
			renewable energy in the next three years. And we are 
			putting Americans to work making our homes and buildings more 
			efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow 
			our economy at the same time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the only though 
			that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a 
			gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy 
			is the profitable kind of energy.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are those who've 
			argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we 
			shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy 
			recovers. And they are right that we have to take into account the 
			costs of transition. Transitioning to a clean energy economy will 
			not be easy. But we can no longer delay putting a framework for a 
			clean energy economy in place. That needs to be done now.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If businesses and 
			entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution 
			loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now. And pretty 
			soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and 
			workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing 
			fuel-efficient cars. Investors will put some money into a new energy 
			technology, and a small business will open to start selling it. 
			That's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and 
			protect our planet at the same time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the fourth pillar 
			of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where 
			families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by 
			skyrocketing insurance premiums. One and a half million 
			Americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical 
			crisis. Major American corporations are struggling to compete with 
			their foreign counterparts. Small businesses are closing their 
			doors. We can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling 
			our economy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why our 
			Recovery Act will invest in electronic health records with strict 
			privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical 
			error. That's why we've made the largest investment ever in 
			preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs 
			under control. And included in the budgets that just passed Congress 
			is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality 
			health care affordable for every American. So I'm 
			looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties 
			in Congress to make this reform a reality. We can get this done -- 
			and we have to get it done.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, fixing our health 
			care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be 
			free. But in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for 
			reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific 
			savings that will make the health care system more efficient and 
			reduce costs for us all.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, we've 
			undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in 
			every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our 
			new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy 
			recovers.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Already we've identified 
			$2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade. We 
			need to do more, but we've already done that. We've announced 
			procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and 
			save the government $40 billion. We need to do more, but that's an 
			important start. Secretary Gates recently announced a courageous set 
			of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in 
			waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without 
			making America safer. We need to do more, but that proposal by 
			Secretary Gates is right on target. We will end education programs 
			that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our 
			Medicare program.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Altogether, this budget 
			will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share 
			of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the 
			lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a 
			century ago. And as we continue to go through the federal budget 
			line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by 
			eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need so we can 
			make room for the things that we do need.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what we're doing 
			now. Of course, I realize that for some, this isn't enough. I know 
			there's a criticism out there that my administration has been 
			spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda 
			while mortgaging our children's future. You've heard the argument.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, let me make three 
			points. First, as I said earlier, the worst thing that we could do 
			in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at 
			the same time as families and businesses around the world are 
			cutting back on their spending. So as serious as our deficit and 
			debt problems are -- and they are very serious -- major efforts to 
			deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget 
			picture, not on the short-term. And that's exactly what we've done.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, in tackling the 
			deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments 
			that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity. That's 
			the argument that some critics have made: Well, you're proposing 
			health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing 
			education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the 
			deficit.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look, just as a 
			cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will 
			still insist on spending money to get their children through 
			college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go 
			to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in 
			some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the 
			long term -- so we as a country have to make current choices with an 
			eye for the future.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we don't invest now 
			in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, 
			if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this 
			economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 
			10 years down the road. If we don't lay this new foundation now, it 
			won't be long before we're right back where we are today. And I can 
			assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term 
			budget situation. That's the second point.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third point, the problem 
			with our deficit and debt is not new. It has been building 
			dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts 
			combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs 
			of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards. This 
			structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's 
			coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get 
			worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an 
			unsustainable path.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let's not kid 
			ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a 
			few earmarks or cutting the budget for the National Endowment for 
			the Arts. That's just not true. Along with defense and 
			interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our 
			budget are entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social 
			Security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year. So 
			if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and I do, then 
			we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary 
			budget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get 
			serious about entitlement reform.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, nothing will be 
			more important to this goal than passing health care reform that 
			brings down costs across the system, including in Medicare and 
			Medicaid. So make no mistake, health care reform is 
			entitlement reform. That's not just my opinion -- that was the 
			conclusion of a wide range of participants at the Fiscal 
			Responsibility Summit that we held at the White House in February. 
			And that's one of the reasons why I firmly believe we need to get 
			health care reform done this year.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once we tackle rising 
			health care costs, we must also work to put Social Security on 
			firmer footing. It's time for both parties to come together and find 
			a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future 
			generations. And we should restore a sense of fairness and balance 
			to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and 
			ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of these efforts 
			will require tough choices. All these efforts will require 
			compromise. But the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for 
			inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point I'd 
			like to make today. I've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness 
			in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning. But we also 
			arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political 
			system.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For too long, too many 
			in Washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some 
			other day. There's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring 
			political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real 
			problems.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There's also an 
			impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that 
			has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on 
			instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher 
			poll numbers. When a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from 
			shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the 
			moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved 
			on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges 
			that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This can't be one of 
			those times. The challenges are too great. The stakes are too high. 
			I know how difficult it is for members of Congress in both parties 
			to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now. I'd 
			love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of 
			five or six at a time. It's more than most Congresses and most 
			Presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we have been called 
			to govern in extraordinary times. And that requires an extraordinary 
			sense of responsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who 
			sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected 
			for good or for ill because of what we do here.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no doubt that 
			times are still tough. By no means are we out of the woods just yet. 
			But from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to 
			see glimmers of hope. And beyond that, way off in the distance, we 
			can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than 
			our troubled economic past. It's an America teeming with new 
			industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that 
			light the world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with 
			a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so 
			much about.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the house upon 
			the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest 
			storms. And we will not finish it in one year. We will not finish it 
			in many. But if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we 
			come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist 
			and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will 
			surely lie ahead, then I have no doubt that this house will stand 
			and the dream of our founders will live on in our time.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
