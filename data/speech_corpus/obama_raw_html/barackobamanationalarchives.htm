transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good morning, everybody.&nbsp; 
		Please be seated.&nbsp; Thank you all for being here.&nbsp; Let me just 
		acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding Cabinet members and 
		advisors.&nbsp; We've got our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; We have 
		our CIA Director Leon Panetta.&nbsp; We have our Secretary of Defense William 
		Gates; Secretary Napolitano of Department of Homeland Security; Attorney 
		General Eric Holder; my National Security Advisor Jim Jones.&nbsp; And I want 
		to especially thank our Acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne 
		Thomas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I also want to acknowledge 
		several members of the House who have great interest in intelligence 
		matters.&nbsp; I want to thank Congressman Reyes, Congressman Hoekstra, 
		Congressman King, as well as Congressman Thompson, for being here 
		today.&nbsp; Thank you so much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These are extraordinary 
		times for our country.&nbsp; We're confronting a historic economic crisis.&nbsp; 
		We're fighting two wars.&nbsp; We face a range of challenges that will define 
		the way that Americans will live in the 21st century.&nbsp; So there's no 
		shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we've begun to make 
		progress.&nbsp; Just this week, we've taken steps to protect American 
		consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government 
		contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our 
		money more wisely.&nbsp; The -- it's a good bill.&nbsp; The engines of our economy 
		are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform 
		on health care and on energy.&nbsp; I want to say to the members of Congress, 
		I welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last 
		four months on these and other issues.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the midst of all these 
		challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as 
		President is to keep the American people safe.&nbsp; It's the first thing 
		that I think about when I wake up in the morning.&nbsp; It's the last thing 
		that I think about when I go to sleep at night.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this responsibility is 
		only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our 
		people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do 
		us great harm.&nbsp; We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest 
		attack on American soil in our history.&nbsp; We know that al Qaeda is 
		actively planning to attack us again.&nbsp; We know that this threat will be 
		with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power 
		to defeat it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Already, we've taken several 
		steps to achieve that goal.&nbsp; For the first time since 2002, we're 
		providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the 
		fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and 
		Pakistan.&nbsp; We're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence 
		capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble 
		enemy.&nbsp; We have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny 
		the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest 
		weapons.&nbsp; And we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear 
		materials within four years.&nbsp; We're better protecting our border, and 
		increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.&nbsp; 
		We're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, 
		and defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates.&nbsp; And we have renewed American 
		diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly 
		lead the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These steps are all critical 
		to keeping America secure.&nbsp; But I believe with every fiber of my being 
		that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we 
		enlist the power of our most fundamental values.&nbsp; The documents that we 
		hold in this very hall -- the Declaration of Independence, the 
		Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- these are not simply words written 
		into aging parchment.&nbsp; They are the foundation of liberty and justice in 
		this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, 
		fairness, equality, and dignity around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I stand here today as 
		someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.&nbsp; My father 
		came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.&nbsp; My 
		mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a 
		child in a foreign land.&nbsp; My own American journey was paved by 
		generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- &quot;to 
		form a more perfect union.&quot;&nbsp; I've studied the Constitution as a student, 
		I've taught it as a teacher, I've been bound by it as a lawyer and a 
		legislator.&nbsp; I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the 
		Constitution as Commander-in-Chief, and as a citizen, I know that we 
		must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for 
		expedience sake.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I make this claim not simply 
		as a matter of idealism.&nbsp; We uphold our most cherished values not only 
		because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it 
		keeps us safe.&nbsp; Time and again, our values have been our best national 
		security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of 
		upheaval.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fidelity to our values is 
		the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of 
		colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the 
		world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's the reason why enemy 
		soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better 
		treatment from America's Armed Forces than from their own government.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's the reason why America 
		has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn 
		a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's the reason why we've 
		been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron 
		curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples 
		everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From Europe to the Pacific, 
		we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced 
		tyranny with the rule of law.&nbsp; That is who we are.&nbsp; And where terrorists 
		offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must 
		demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than 
		a hateful ideology.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After 9/11, we knew that we 
		had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of 
		war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our 
		government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that 
		these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply 
		prosecuting those who try to carry them out.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, faced with an 
		uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.&nbsp; I 
		believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire 
		to protect the American people.&nbsp; But I also believe that all too often 
		our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that 
		all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit 
		ideological predispositions.&nbsp; Instead of strategically applying our 
		power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as 
		luxuries that we could no longer afford.&nbsp; And during this season of 
		fear, too many of us -- Democrats and Republicans, politicians, 
		journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In other words, we went off 
		course.&nbsp; And this is not my assessment alone.&nbsp; It was an assessment that 
		was shared by the American people who nominated candidates for President 
		from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a 
		new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the 
		imperative of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now let me be clear:&nbsp; We are 
		indeed at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.&nbsp; We do need to update 
		our institutions to deal with this threat.&nbsp; But we must do so with an 
		abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and 
		balances and accountability.&nbsp; For reasons that I will explain, the 
		decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc 
		legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor 
		sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions 
		and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a 
		compass.&nbsp; And that's why I took several steps upon taking office to 
		better protect the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, I banned the use of 
		so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of 
		America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know some have argued that 
		brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.&nbsp; I 
		could not disagree more.&nbsp; As Commander-in-Chief, I see the 
		intelligence.&nbsp; I bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.&nbsp; 
		And I categorically reject the assertion that these are the most 
		effective means of interrogation.&nbsp; What's more, they undermine the rule 
		of law.&nbsp; They alienate us in the world.&nbsp; They serve as a recruitment 
		tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, 
		while decreasing the will of others to work with America.&nbsp; They risk the 
		lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender 
		to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if 
		they are captured.&nbsp; In short, they did not advance our war and 
		counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why I 
		ended them once and for all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I should add, the 
		arguments against these techniques did not originate from my 
		administration.&nbsp; As Senator McCain once said, torture &quot;serves as a great 
		propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us.&quot;&nbsp; And 
		even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his 
		own administration -- including a Secretary of State, other senior 
		officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that 
		those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, 
		and the wrong side of history.&nbsp; That's why we must leave these methods 
		where they belong -- in the past.&nbsp; They are not who we are, and they are 
		not America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second decision that I 
		made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For over seven years, we 
		have detained hundreds of people at Guantanamo.&nbsp; During that time, the 
		system of military commissions that were in place at Guantanamo 
		succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.&nbsp; 
		Let me repeat that:&nbsp; three convictions in over seven years.&nbsp; Instead of 
		bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after 
		setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the Supreme Court invalidated 
		the entire system.&nbsp; Meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from 
		Guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous 
		administration.&nbsp; Let me repeat that:&nbsp; Two-thirds of the detainees were 
		released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantanamo.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is also no question 
		that Guantanamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest 
		currency in the world.&nbsp; Instead of building a durable framework for the 
		struggle against al Qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and 
		traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the 
		rule of law.&nbsp; In fact, part of the rationale for establishing Guantanamo 
		in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be 
		beyond the law -- a proposition that the Supreme Court soundly 
		rejected.&nbsp; Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, 
		Guantanamo became a symbol that helped al Qaeda recruit terrorists to 
		its cause.&nbsp; Indeed, the existence of Guantanamo likely created more 
		terrorists around the world than it ever detained.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So the record is clear:&nbsp; 
		Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened 
		American national security.&nbsp; It is a rallying cry for our enemies.&nbsp; It 
		sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an 
		enemy that operates in scores of countries.&nbsp; By any measure, the costs 
		of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.&nbsp; 
		That's why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and 
		that is why I ordered it closed within one year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The third decision that I 
		made was to order a review of all pending cases at Guantanamo.&nbsp; I knew 
		when I ordered Guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and 
		complex.&nbsp; There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal 
		limbo.&nbsp; In dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of 
		starting from scratch.&nbsp; We're cleaning up something that is, quite 
		simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a 
		flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with 
		on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of 
		government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our 
		country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, the legal challenges 
		that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in Washington 
		would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantanamo.&nbsp; For 
		example, the court order to release 17 Uighurs -- 17 Uighur detainees 
		took place last fall, when George Bush was President.&nbsp; The Supreme Court 
		that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantanamo in 2006 was 
		overwhelmingly appointed by Republican Presidents -- not wild-eyed 
		liberals.&nbsp; In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantanamo 
		detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the 
		problem exists because of the decision to open Guantanamo in the first 
		place.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now let me be blunt.&nbsp; There 
		are no neat or easy answers here.&nbsp; I wish there were.&nbsp; But I can tell 
		you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away 
		if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.&nbsp; As President, I refuse to 
		allow this problem to fester.&nbsp; I refuse to pass it on to somebody else.&nbsp; 
		It is my responsibility to solve the problem.&nbsp; Our security interests 
		will not permit us to delay.&nbsp; Our courts won't allow it.&nbsp; And neither 
		should our conscience.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, over the last several 
		weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that 
		have characterized the last several years.&nbsp; I'm an elected official; I 
		understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.&nbsp; They should.&nbsp; 
		We're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a 
		democracy can face.&nbsp; But I have no interest in spending all of our time 
		relitigating the policies of the last eight years.&nbsp; I'll leave that to 
		others.&nbsp; I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them 
		together as Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we will be ill-served by 
		some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.&nbsp; 
		Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that, frankly, are 
		calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have 
		more to do with politics than protecting our country.&nbsp; So I want to take 
		this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to 
		resolve these outstanding issues.&nbsp; I will explain how each action that 
		we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the 
		American people and the values that we hold most dear.&nbsp; And I'll focus 
		on two broad areas:&nbsp; first, issues relating to Guantanamo and our 
		detention policy; but, second, I also want to discuss issues relating to 
		security and transparency.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, let me begin by 
		disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:&nbsp; We are not going to 
		release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we 
		release detainees within the United States who endanger the American 
		people.&nbsp; Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek 
		to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we 
		hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- 
		namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we make these decisions, 
		bear in mind the following face:&nbsp; Nobody has ever escaped from one of 
		our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted 
		terrorists.&nbsp; As Republican Lindsey Graham said, the idea that we cannot 
		find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United 
		States is not rational.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are currently in the 
		process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantanamo to 
		determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.&nbsp; And as we do 
		so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees 
		were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.&nbsp; That's 
		why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that 
		let those detainees go in the past.&nbsp; Instead we are treating these cases 
		with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security 
		demands.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, going forward, these 
		cases will fall into five distinct categories.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, whenever feasible, we 
		will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal 
		courts -- courts provided for by the United States Constitution.&nbsp; Some 
		have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of 
		terrorists.&nbsp; They are wrong.&nbsp; Our courts and our juries, our citizens, 
		are tough enough to convict terrorists.&nbsp; The record makes that clear.&nbsp; 
		Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center.&nbsp; He was convicted 
		in our courts and is serving a life sentence in U.S. prisons.&nbsp; Zacarias 
		Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.&nbsp; He was 
		convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in 
		prison.&nbsp; If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in 
		our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantanamo.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recently, we prosecuted and 
		received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-Marri, in federal court after 
		years of legal confusion.&nbsp; We're preparing to transfer another detainee 
		to the Southern District Court of New York, where he will face trial on 
		charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and 
		Tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.&nbsp; Preventing this 
		detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and 
		conviction.&nbsp; And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that 
		justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second category of cases 
		involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best 
		tried through military commissions.&nbsp; Military commissions have a history 
		in the United States dating back to George Washington and the 
		Revolutionary War.&nbsp; They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees 
		for violations of the laws of war.&nbsp; They allow for the protection of 
		sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for 
		the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of 
		evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively 
		presented in federal courts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, some have suggested 
		that this represents a reversal on my part.&nbsp; They should look at the 
		record.&nbsp; In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush 
		administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish 
		a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process 
		rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I said at that time, 
		however, that I supported the use of military commissions to try 
		detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were 
		some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.&nbsp; Those are the reforms 
		that we are now making.&nbsp; Instead of using the flawed commissions of the 
		last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line 
		with the rule of law.&nbsp; We will no longer permit the use of evidence -- 
		as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or 
		degrading interrogation methods.&nbsp; We will no longer place the burden to 
		prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.&nbsp; And we 
		will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and 
		more protections if they refuse to testify.&nbsp; These reforms, among 
		others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective 
		means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and 
		members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the 
		political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are 
		fair, legitimate, and effective.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The third category of 
		detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.&nbsp; 
		Now, let me repeat what I said earlier:&nbsp; This has nothing to do with my 
		decision to close Guantanamo.&nbsp; It has to do with the rule of law.&nbsp; The 
		courts have spoken.&nbsp; They have found that there's no legitimate reason 
		to hold 21 of the people currently held at Guantanamo.&nbsp; Nineteen of 
		these findings took place before I was sworn into office.&nbsp; I cannot 
		ignore these rulings because as President, I too am bound by the law.&nbsp; 
		The United States is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these 
		rulings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fourth category of cases 
		involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to 
		another country.&nbsp; So far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for 
		transfer.&nbsp; And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number 
		of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for 
		detention and rehabilitation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, finally, there remains 
		the question of detainees at Guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who 
		pose a clear danger to the American people.&nbsp; And I have to be honest 
		here -- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.&nbsp; We're 
		going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at 
		Guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.&nbsp; But even when this process 
		is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted 
		for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who 
		nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States.&nbsp; 
		Examples of that threat include people who've received extensive 
		explosives training at al Qaeda training camps, or commanded Taliban 
		troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or 
		otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans.&nbsp; These are 
		people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me repeat:&nbsp; I am not 
		going to release individuals who endanger the American people.&nbsp; Al Qaeda 
		terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and 
		those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be 
		prevented from attacking us again.&nbsp; Having said that, we must recognize 
		that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.&nbsp; They can't be based 
		simply on what I or the executive branch decide alone.&nbsp; That's why my 
		administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure 
		that they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, 
		defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.&nbsp; 
		We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.&nbsp; We must 
		have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged 
		detention is carefully evaluated and justified.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know that creating such a 
		system poses unique challenges. And other countries have grappled with 
		this question; now, so must we.&nbsp; But I want to be very clear that our 
		goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining 
		Guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.&nbsp; Our goal is not to 
		avoid a legitimate legal framework.&nbsp; In our constitutional system, 
		prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.&nbsp; If and 
		when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep 
		them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that 
		involves judicial and congressional oversight.&nbsp; And so, going forward, 
		my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate 
		legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our 
		Constitution.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, as our efforts to close 
		Guantanamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be 
		difficult.&nbsp; These are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.&nbsp; 
		You can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote 
		on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.&nbsp; I get it.&nbsp; But if 
		we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make 
		more mistakes.&nbsp; And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I 
		guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to 
		combat terrorism in the future.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have confidence that the 
		American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect 
		this country than in political posturing.&nbsp; I am not the only person in 
		this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution -- so did each 
		and every member of Congress.&nbsp; And together we have a responsibility to 
		enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave 
		behind the legacy that makes it easier for future Presidents to keep 
		this country safe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, let me touch on a 
		second set of issues that relate to security and transparency.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">National security requires a 
		delicate balance.&nbsp; One the one hand, our democracy depends on 
		transparency.&nbsp; On the other hand, some information must be protected 
		from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the 
		movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information 
		we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.&nbsp; In these and 
		other cases, lives are at stake.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, several weeks ago, as 
		part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous 
		administration's Office of Legal Counsel.&nbsp; I did not do this because I 
		disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos 
		authorized, and I didn't release the documents because I rejected their 
		legal rationales -- although I do on both counts.&nbsp; I released the memos 
		because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already 
		widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, 
		and I had already banned those methods.&nbsp; The argument that somehow by 
		releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about 
		how they will be interrogated makes no sense.&nbsp; We will not be 
		interrogating terrorists using that approach.&nbsp; That approach is now 
		prohibited.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In short, I released these 
		memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.&nbsp; And the 
		ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how 
		these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the other hand, I 
		recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of 
		detainees by U.S. personnel between 2002 and 2004.&nbsp; Individuals who 
		violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated 
		and they have been held accountable.&nbsp; There was and is no debate as to 
		whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.&nbsp; Nothing has been 
		concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.&nbsp; However, it was my 
		judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing 
		these photos would inflame anti-American opinion and allow our enemies 
		to paint U.S. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, 
		thereby endangering them in theaters of war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In short, there is a clear 
		and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.&nbsp; There are 
		nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a 
		solemn responsibility for their safety as Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; Nothing 
		would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than 
		the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, in the press's mind and 
		in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.&nbsp; They 
		are not to me.&nbsp; In each of these cases, I had to strike the right 
		balance between transparency and national security.&nbsp; And this balance 
		brings with it a precious responsibility.&nbsp; There's no doubt that the 
		American people have seen this balance tested over the last several 
		years.&nbsp; In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation 
		techniques made public long before I was President, the American people 
		learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the 
		ideals that generations of Americans have fought for.&nbsp; And whether it 
		was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, 
		Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily 
		withheld from them.&nbsp; And that caused suspicion to build up.&nbsp; And that 
		leads to a thirst for accountability.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I understand that.&nbsp; I ran 
		for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.&nbsp; And 
		that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all 
		information available to the American people so that they can make 
		informed judgments and hold us accountable.&nbsp; But I have never argued -- 
		and I never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters 
		should simply be an open book.&nbsp; I will never abandon -- and will 
		vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our 
		troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard 
		confidential actions that keep the American people safe.&nbsp; Here's the 
		difference though:&nbsp; Whenever we cannot release certain information to 
		the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there 
		is oversight of my actions -- by Congress or by the courts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We're currently launching a 
		review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the 
		classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and 
		to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to 
		review executive branch decisions on these matters.&nbsp; Because in our 
		system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the 
		watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- 
		information.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, along these same lines, 
		my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the 
		&quot;state secrets&quot; privilege.&nbsp; This is a doctrine that allows the 
		government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.&nbsp; It's 
		been used by many past Presidents -- Republican and Democrat -- for many 
		decades.&nbsp; And while this principle is absolutely necessary in some 
		circumstances to protect national security, I am concerned that it has 
		been over-used.&nbsp; It is also currently the subject of a wide range of 
		lawsuits.&nbsp; So let me lay out some principles here.&nbsp; We must not protect 
		information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or 
		embarrassment to the government.&nbsp; And that's why my administration is 
		nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we plan to embrace 
		several principles for reform.&nbsp; We will apply a stricter legal test to 
		material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.&nbsp; We 
		will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own 
		formal process, including review by a Justice Department committee and 
		the personal approval of the Attorney General.&nbsp; And each year we will 
		voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and 
		why because, as I said before, there must be proper oversight over our 
		actions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On all these matters related 
		to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that 
		there was some simple formula out there to be had.&nbsp; There is not.&nbsp; These 
		often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require 
		a surgical approach.&nbsp; But the common thread that runs through all of my 
		decisions is simple:&nbsp; We will safeguard what we must to protect the 
		American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and 
		oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.&nbsp; I will 
		never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.&nbsp; I will deal with 
		Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.&nbsp; I will tell 
		the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release 
		something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, in all the areas that 
		I've discussed today, the policies that I've proposed represent a new 
		direction from the last eight years.&nbsp; To protect the American people and 
		our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.&nbsp; We are 
		closing the prison at Guantanamo.&nbsp; We are reforming military 
		commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain 
		terrorists.&nbsp; We are declassifying more information and embracing more 
		oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state 
		secrets privilege.&nbsp; These are dramatic changes that will put our 
		approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable 
		footing.&nbsp; Their implementation will take time, but they will get done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a core principle 
		that we will apply to all of our actions.&nbsp; Even as we clean up the mess 
		at Guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our 
		decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the 
		public.&nbsp; We seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for 
		addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate 
		politics, but to do what's right over the long term.&nbsp; By doing that we 
		can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my 
		presidency, that endures for the next President and the President after 
		that -- a legacy that protects the American people and enjoys a broad 
		legitimacy at home and abroad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, this is what I mean 
		when I say that we need to focus on the future.&nbsp; I recognize that many 
		still have a strong desire to focus on the past.&nbsp; When it comes to 
		actions of the last eight years, passions are high.&nbsp; Some Americans are 
		angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some 
		cases debates that they have lost.&nbsp; I know that these debates lead 
		directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps 
		through an independent commission.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've opposed the creation of 
		such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic 
		institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.&nbsp; The Congress 
		can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the 
		Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.&nbsp; The 
		Department of Justice and our courts can work through and punish any 
		violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's no secret there is a 
		tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one 
		another.&nbsp; And it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse 
		that lead to a good fight and good copy.&nbsp; But nothing will contribute 
		more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.&nbsp; 
		Already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in 
		Washington to different sides to laying blame.&nbsp; It can distract us from 
		focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of 
		the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We see that, above all, in 
		the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and 
		sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.&nbsp; On the one side of the 
		spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique 
		challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national 
		security over transparency.&nbsp; And on the other end of the spectrum, there 
		are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:&nbsp; 
		&quot;Anything goes.&quot;&nbsp; Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting 
		terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the President 
		should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is 
		a President with whom they agree.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both sides may be sincere in 
		their views, but neither side is right.&nbsp; The American people are not 
		absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our 
		problems.&nbsp; They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our 
		values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we 
		approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common 
		sense.&nbsp; That, after all, is the unique genius of America.&nbsp; That's the 
		challenge laid down by our Constitution.&nbsp; That has been the source of 
		our strength through the ages.&nbsp; That's what makes the United States of 
		America different as a nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I can stand here today, as 
		President of the United States, and say without exception or 
		equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect 
		our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us 
		to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.&nbsp; Make no mistake:&nbsp; 
		If we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past 
		several years, then I will not be able to say that as President.&nbsp; And if 
		we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with 
		the documents that are enshrined in this hall.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Framers who drafted the 
		Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded 
		over the last 222 years.&nbsp; But our Constitution has endured through 
		secession and civil rights, through World War and Cold War, because it 
		provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; 
		it provides a compass that can help us find our way.&nbsp; It hasn't always 
		been easy.&nbsp; We are an imperfect people.&nbsp; Every now and then, there are 
		those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk 
		away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.&nbsp; And we hear 
		such voices today.&nbsp; But over the long haul the American people have 
		resisted that temptation.&nbsp; And though we've made our share of mistakes, 
		required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the 
		principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the 
		world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now this generation faces a 
		great test in the specter of terrorism.&nbsp; And unlike the Civil War or 
		World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this 
		journey to an end.&nbsp; Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded 
		cities, there are people plotting to take American lives.&nbsp; That will be 
		the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability 
		-- 10 years from now.&nbsp; Neither I nor anyone can stand here today and say 
		that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American 
		lives.&nbsp; But I can say with certainty that my administration -- along 
		with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend 
		our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the 
		American people safe.&nbsp; And I do know with certainty that we can defeat 
		al Qaeda.&nbsp; Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their 
		ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able 
		to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable 
		approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless 
		ideals.&nbsp; This must be our common purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I ran for President because 
		I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we 
		solve them together.&nbsp; We will not be safe if we see national security as 
		a wedge that divides America -- it can and must be a cause that unites 
		us as one people and as one nation.&nbsp; We've done so before in times that 
		were more perilous than ours.&nbsp; We will do so once again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, God bless you, 
		and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
