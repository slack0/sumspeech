transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you 
everybody.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To -- To Chairman Dean, and my great 
friend, Dick Durbin, and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation, with 
profound gratitude and great humility -- I accept your nomination for the 
presidency of the United States.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me -- Let 
me express -- Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who 
accompanied on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest, a 
champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and yours: 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To President 
Clinton -- To President Bill Clinton, who made last night the case for change as 
only he can make it, to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service, and to 
the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am 
grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a 
man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak 
train he still takes home every night, to the love of my life -- the next First 
Lady, Michelle Obama; and to Mahlia and Sasha, I love you so much and I am so 
proud of you.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Four years ago, 
<a href="../convention2004/barackobama2004dnc.htm"><font color="#0000FF">I stood before you and told you my story</font></a><font color="#0000FF">
</font>of the brief union 
between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't 
well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could 
achieve whatever he put his mind to.<br>
<br>
It is that promise that's always set this country apart -- that through hard 
work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come 
together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue 
their dreams as well.<br>
<br>
It's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at 
each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women, students 
and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to 
keep it alive.<br>
<br>
We meet at one of those defining moments -- a moment when our nation is at war, 
our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once 
more. <br>
<br>
Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. 
More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. 
More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit cards bills [sic] you can't 
afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach<br>
<br>
These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond 
is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies 
of George W. Bush. <br>
<br>
America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than 
this. This country's more decent than one woman in Ohio on the brink of 
retirement finds herself one disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're a better country than one 
where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment that's he's worked on for 
twenty years and watch as its shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he 
explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the 
news.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are more compassionate than a 
government that lets veterans sleep on our streets, and families slide into 
poverty; that sits -- that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns 
before our eyes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight -- Tonight I say to the 
people of America, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this 
great land: Enough! <br>
<br>
This moment -- This moment -- this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the 
American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same Party that 
brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a 
third. And we are here -- we are here because we love this country too much to let the next 
four years look just like the last eight. On November 4th -- On November 4th, we must stand up and 
say: &quot;Eight is enough.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now -- Now let me -- let -- let there be no doubt: The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the 
uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our 
gratitude and our respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when 
he's broken with his Party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we 
need. <br>
<br>
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent 
of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does 
it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety 
percent of the time? I -- I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten 
percent chance on change.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth is on issue after issue 
that would make a difference in your lives -- on health care and education and 
the economy, Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He says that our 
economy has made great progress under this President. He said that the 
fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors -- 
the man who wrote his economic plan -- was talking about the anxieties that 
Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a mental 
recession, and that we've become -- and I quote -- &quot;a nation of whiners.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A nation of whiners.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tell that to the proud autoworkers 
at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up 
everyday and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who 
counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who 
shoulder their burden silently as they watch their loved ones leave for there 
third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are not whiners. They work 
hard and they give back and they keep going without complaint. These are the 
Americans I know.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I don't believe that Senator 
McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he 
doesn't know. Why else would he define &quot;middle-class&quot; as someone making under 
five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in 
tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax 
relief to more than one hundred million Americans? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">How else could he offer a health 
care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that 
would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would 
privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's not because John McCain doesn't 
care; it's because John McCain doesn't get it. For over two decades -- For over 
two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy: 
Give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down 
to everyone else.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Washington, they call this the 
&quot;Ownership Society,&quot; but what it really means is that you're on your own. Out of 
work? Tough luck, you're on your own. No health care? The market will fix it. 
You're on your own. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, 
even if you don't have boots. You are on your own. Well, it's time for them to 
own their failure. It's time for us to change America. And that's why I'm 
running for President of the United States.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see -- You see, we Democrats have 
a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We 
measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, 
whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you 
can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in 
the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President, when 
the average American family saw its income go up 7,500 dollars instead of go down 
2,000 dollars, like it has under George Bush.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We measure the strength of our 
economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 
500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new 
business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look 
after a sick kid without losing her job, an economy that honors the dignity of 
work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fundamentals we use to measure 
economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that 
has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason I am standing 
here tonight.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because, in the faces of those young 
veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who 
signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a 
grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the face of that young student, 
who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my 
mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her 
degree, who once turned to food stamps, but was still able to send us to the 
best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I -- When I listen to another 
worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and 
women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago 
after the local steel plant closed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And when I hear a woman talk about 
the difficulties of starting her own business or making her way in the world, I 
think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to 
middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she 
was a woman. She's the one who taught me about 
hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself 
so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And 
although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight and that 
tonight is her night, as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now -- Now , I don't know what kind of lives 
John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes; theirs are the 
stories that shaped my life. And it is on behalf of them that I intend to win 
this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What -- What is that American 
promise? It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own 
lives what we will, but that we also have obligations to treat each other with 
dignity and respect.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a promise that says the market 
should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses 
should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, to look out 
for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ours -- Ours is a promise that says 
government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we 
cannot do for ourselves: protect us from harm and provide every child a decent 
education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools, and 
new roads, and science, and technology.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our government should work for us, 
not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not 
just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's 
willing to work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the promise of America, the 
idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one 
nation, the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's 
keeper.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the promise we need to keep. 
That's the change we need right now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So -- So let me -- let me spell out 
exactly what that change would mean if I am President. Change means a tax code that doesn't 
reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses 
who deserve it. You know, unlike John McCain, I will 
stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and I will start 
giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I'll eliminate capital gains taxes 
for the small businesses and start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech 
jobs of tomorrow. I will -- listen now -- I will cut 
taxes -- cut taxes -- for 95 percent of all working families, because, in an 
economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle 
class. And for the sake of our economy, our 
security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: In 
10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will do this.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Washington -- 
Washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years. And, 
by the way, John McCain has been there for 26 of them. And in that time, he has said no to 
higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investment in renewable 
energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil 
than we had on the day that Senator McCain took office. Now is the time to end this 
addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term 
solution, not even close.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As President -- As President, I will 
tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to 
safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the 
fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American 
people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over 
the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy -- wind power, and 
solar power, and the next generation of biofuels -- an investment that will lead 
to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, now is not the time for 
small plans. Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide 
every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to 
compete in the global economy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, Michelle and I are only 
here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not 
settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood 
education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries, 
and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and 
more accountability. And we will keep our promise to 
every young American: If you commit to serving your community or our country, we 
will make sure you can afford a college education.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now -- Now is the time to finally 
keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single 
American. If you have health care -- If you 
have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able 
to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And -- And as someone who watched my 
mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I 
will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick 
and need care the most.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now is the time to help families 
with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should 
have to choose between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or an 
ailing parent.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now is the time to change our 
bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses, and 
the time to protect Social Security for future generations.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now is the time to keep the 
promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to 
have the exact same opportunities as your sons.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, many of these plans will cost 
money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime: by closing 
corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the 
federal budget line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making 
the ones we do need work better and cost less, because we cannot meet 
21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, Democrats -- Democrats, we must 
also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. 
It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover 
what John F. Kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength. Yes, government must lead on energy 
independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses 
more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to 
success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also 
admit that programs alone can't replace parents, that government can't turn off 
the television and make a child do her homework, that fathers must take more 
responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children. Individual responsibility and mutual 
responsibility, that's the essence of America's promise. And just as we keep our 
promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise 
abroad.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If John McCain wants to have a 
debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next 
Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For -- For while -- while Senator 
McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and 
opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that 
we face. When John McCain said we could just 
muddle through in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to 
finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and 
made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have 
them in our sights. You know, John McCain likes to say 
that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of Hell, but he won't even follow him 
to the cave where he lives. And today -- today, as my call for a 
timeframe to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government 
and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has 79 
billion dollars in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit, John McCain stands alone 
in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's not the judgment we need; 
that won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of 
the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past. You don't defeat -- You don't defeat 
a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't 
protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't 
truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow 
George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice, but that 
is not the change that America needs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are the Party of Roosevelt. We 
are the Party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this 
country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bush-McCain foreign policy has 
squandered the legacy that generations of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, 
have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Commander-in-Chief, I will never 
hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way 
with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they 
need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home. I will end this war in Iraq 
responsibly and finish the fight against Al Qaida and the Taliban in 
Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts, but I will 
also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining 
nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to 
defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation, 
poverty and genocide, climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral 
standing so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are 
called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a 
better future.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These -- These are the policies I 
will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John 
McCain.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what I will not do is suggest 
that the senator takes his positions for political purposes, because one of the 
things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot 
disagree without challenging each other's character and each other's patriotism. The times are too serious; the 
stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that 
patriotism has no Party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John 
McCain. The men and women who serve in our 
battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and independents, but they have 
fought together, and bled together, and some died together under the same proud 
flag. They have not served a red America or a blue America; they have served the 
United States of America. So I've got news for you, John 
McCain: We all put our country first.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, our work will not be easy. 
The challenges we face require tough choices. And Democrats, as well as 
Republicans, will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past, 
for part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by 
lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of 
common purpose, and that's what we have to restore.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We may not agree on abortion, but 
surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this 
country.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The -- The reality of gun ownership 
may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by 
gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second 
Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are differences on 
same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and 
sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives 
free of discrimination.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, passions may fly on 
immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated 
from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal 
workers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But this, too, is part of America's 
promise, the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to 
bridge divides and unite in common effort.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are those who dismiss 
such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, 
something firmer, and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for 
higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected, because 
if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run 
on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a 
big election about small things. And you know what? It's worked 
before, because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When 
Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been 
dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping and settle for what you 
already know.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I get it. I realize that I am not 
the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I 
haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington. But I stand before you tonight 
because all across America something is stirring. What the naysayers don't 
understand is that this election has never been about me; it's about you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's about you. For 18 long months, you have stood 
up, one by one, and said, &quot;Enough,&quot; to the politics of the past. You understand 
that, in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same, old 
politics with the same, old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches 
us, that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from 
Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens -- Change happens 
because the American people demand it, because they rise up and insist on new 
ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, this is one of those 
moments.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe that, as hard as it will 
be, the change we need is coming, because I've seen it, because I've lived it. 
Because I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children 
and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, where 
we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more 
accountable, to give better care for our veterans, and keep nuclear weapons out 
of the hands of terrorists.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I've seen it in this campaign, 
in the young people who voted for the first time and the young at heart, those 
who got involved again after a very long time; in the Republicans who never 
thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've seen it -- I've seen it in the 
workers who would rather cut their hours back a day, even though they can't 
afford it, than see their friends lose their jobs; in the soldiers who re-enlist 
after losing a limb; in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a 
hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, this country of ours has 
more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most 
powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our 
universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what 
keeps the world coming to our shores.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instead, it is that American spirit, 
that American promise, that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; 
that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye 
not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That promise is our greatest 
inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night 
and a promise that you make to yours, a promise that has led immigrants to cross 
oceans and pioneers to travel west, a promise that led workers to picket lines 
and women to reach for the ballot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is that promise that, 45 
years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand 
together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear 
<a href="../mlkihaveadream.htm"><font color="#0000FF">a young 
preacher from Georgia speak of his Dream</font></a>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The men and women who gathered there 
could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They 
could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams 
deferred. But what the people heard instead -- 
people of every creed and color, from every walk of life -- is that, in America, 
our destiny is inextricably linked, that together our dreams can be one. &quot;We cannot walk alone,&quot; the preacher 
cried. &quot;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march 
ahead. We cannot turn back.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, we cannot turn back, not 
with so much work to be done; not with so many children to educate, and so many 
veterans to care for; not with an economy to fix, and cities to rebuild, and 
farms to save; not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, we cannot turn back. We 
cannot walk alone.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this moment, in this election, we 
must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise, that 
American promise, and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, 
to the hope that we confess.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you. God bless you. And God 
bless the United States of America.</font></p>
