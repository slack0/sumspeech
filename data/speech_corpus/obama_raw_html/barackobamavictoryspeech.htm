transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hello, Chicago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If there is anyone out there 
		who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; 
		who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who 
		still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.<br>
		<br>
		It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches 
		in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours 
		and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because 
		they believed that this time must be different; that their voices could 
		be that difference. <br>
		<br>
		It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and 
		Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, 
		disabled and not disabled -- Americans who sent a message to the world 
		that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection 
		of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United 
		States of America!<br>
		<br>
		It's the answer that -- that led those who have been told for so long by so many 
		to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful about what we can achieve to put 
		their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope 
		of a better day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on 
		this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to 
		America.</font></p>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<a id="more"></a>
		</font>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A little bit earlier this 
		evening, I received an extraordinarily 
		gracious call from Senator McCain. Senator McCain fought long and hard in this 
		campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he 
		loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot 
		begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this 
		brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him; I congratulate Governor Palin for all 
		that they've achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew 
		this nation's promise in the months ahead.<br>
		<br>
		I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from 
		his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets 
		of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the Vice 
		President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden. <br>
		<br>
		And
		I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of 
		my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, 
		the love of my life, the nation's next First Lady: Michelle Obama. Sasha 
		and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy 
		that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with 
		us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made 
		me who I am. I miss them tonight, and I know that my debt to them is 
		beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers 
		and sisters -- thank you so much for the support that you've given me. I 
		am grateful to them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And to my campaign 
		manager, David Plouffe -- the unsung hero of this campaign, who built 
		the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the 
		United States of America. To my chief strategist David Axelrod -- who's 
		been a partner with me every step of the way. To the best campaign team 
		ever assembled in the history of politics -- you made this happen, and I 
		am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But above all, I will 
		never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It 
		belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We 
		didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not 
		hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des 
		Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of 
		Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what 
		little savings they had to give 5 dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars 
		to the cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the 
		myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their 
		families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep. It drew 
		strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and 
		scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the 
		millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more 
		than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and 
		for the people has not perished from the Earth. This is your victory.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I know you didn't do 
		this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You 
		did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. 
		For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow 
		will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in 
		peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here 
		tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of 
		Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There 
		are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall 
		asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' 
		bills or save enough for their child's college education. There's new 
		energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and 
		threats to meet, alliances to repair.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The road ahead will be 
		long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even 
		in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am 
		tonight that we will get there. I promise you,
		<a href="../mlkivebeentothemountaintop.htm"><font color="#0000FF">we as 
		a people will get there</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be setbacks and 
		false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or 
		policy I make as President. And we know the government can't solve every 
		problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we 
		face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, 
		I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way 
		it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by 
		brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. What began 21 months ago in the 
		depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This victory alone is not 
		the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. 
		And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't 
		happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of 
		sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of 
		responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder 
		and look after not only ourselves but each other. Let us remember that, 
		if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a 
		thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. In this country, we rise or 
		fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall 
		back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has 
		poisoned our politics for so long.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let's remember that it was a man from 
		this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the 
		White House, a Party founded on the values of self-reliance and 
		individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all 
		share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, 
		we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the 
		divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation 
		far more divided than ours: &quot;We are not enemies but friends....&quot; &quot;Though 
		passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">¹</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And to those Americans who 
		-- whose 
		support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I 
		hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your President, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And to all those watching 
		tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those 
		who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our 
		stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of 
		American leadership is at hand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To those -- To those who 
		would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace 
		and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if 
		America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we've proved once more that 
		the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or 
		the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: 
		democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's the true genius of 
		America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we've 
		already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve 
		tomorrow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This election had many 
		firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one 
		that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in 
		Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to 
		make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: 
		<a href="http://www.annnixoncooper.com/"><font color="#0000FF">Ann Nixon 
		Cooper</font></a> is 106 years old.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was born just a 
		generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or 
		planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: 
		because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And tonight, I think about 
		all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache 
		and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that 
		we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we 
		can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a time when women's 
		voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them 
		stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot: Yes we can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When there was despair in 
		the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer 
		fear itself with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">
		<font color="#0000FF">New Deal</font></a>, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose: 
		Yes we can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the 
		<a href="../fdrpearlharbor.htm"><font color="#0000FF">bombs fell on our 
		harbor</font></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Reich">
		<font color="#0000FF">tyranny threatened the world</font></a>, she was there to witness a 
		generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved: Yes we can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She was there for the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Bus_Boycott">
		<font color="#0000FF">buses 
		in Montgomery</font></a>, the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_campaign">
		<font color="#0000FF">hoses in Birmingham</font></a>, a 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches">
		<font color="#0000FF">bridge in Selma</font></a>, and a 
		preacher from Atlanta who told a people that &quot;we shall overcome&quot;: Yes we 
		can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A man touched down on the 
		moon, <a href="../ronaldreaganbrandenburggate.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">a wall came down in Berlin</font></a>, a world was connected by our own 
		science and imagination.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this year, in this 
		election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because 
		after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of 
		hours, she knows how America can change: Yes we can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, we have come so 
		far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, 
		let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next 
		century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon 
		Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is our chance to answer 
		that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our 
		people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to 
		restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the 
		American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, 
		we are one;<font color="#FF0000">²</font> that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with 
		cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond 
		with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we 
		can.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></p>
