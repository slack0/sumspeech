		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello, everybody! Thank 
			you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. All right, everybody go ahead 
			and have a seat. How is everybody doing today? How about 
			Tim Spicer? I am here with students at Wakefield High 
			School in Arlington, Virginia. And we've got students tuning in from 
			all across America, from kindergarten through 12th grade. And I am 
			just so glad that all could join us today. And I want to thank 
			Wakefield for being such an outstanding host. Give yourselves a big 
			round of applause.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that for many of 
			you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you in 
			kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day 
			in a new school, so it's understandable if you're a little nervous. 
			I imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty 
			good right now -- with just one more year to go. And 
			no matter what grade you're in, some of you are probably wishing it 
			were still summer and you could've stayed in bed just a little bit 
			longer this morning.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that feeling. 
			When I was young, my family lived overseas. I lived in Indonesia for 
			a few years. And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me 
			where all the American kids went to school, but she thought it was 
			important for me to keep up with an American education. So she 
			decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. 
			But because she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was 
			at 4:30 in the morning.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, as you might 
			imagine, I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. And a lot 
			of times, I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But 
			whenever I'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those 
			looks and she'd say, &quot;This is no picnic for me either, buster.&quot;</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">So I know that some of 
			you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here today 
			because I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here 
			because I want to talk with you about your education and what's 
			expected of all of you in this new school year.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I've given a lot of 
			speeches about education. And I've talked about responsibility a 
			lot.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've talked about 
			teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to 
			learn.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've talked about your 
			parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you 
			get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front 
			of the TV or with the Xbox.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've talked a lot about 
			your government's responsibility for setting high standards, and 
			supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that 
			aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that 
			they deserve.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But at the end of the 
			day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive 
			parents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a 
			difference, none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your 
			responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools, unless you 
			pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents 
			and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes 
			to succeed. That's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility 
			each of you has for your education.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to start with the 
			responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has 
			something that you're good at. Every single one of you has something 
			to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what 
			that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maybe you could be a 
			great writer -- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles 
			in a newspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that 
			English paper -- that English class paper that's assigned to you. 
			Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe even good 
			enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or 
			vaccine -- but you might not know it until you do your project for 
			your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a 
			Supreme Court justice -- but you might not know that until you join 
			student government or the debate team.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And no matter what you 
			want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education 
			to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police 
			officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a 
			member of our military? You're going to need a good education for 
			every single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and 
			just drop into a good job. You've got to train for it and work for 
			it and learn for it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this isn't just 
			important for your own life and your own future. What you make of 
			your education will decide nothing less than the future of this 
			country. The future of America depends on you. What you're learning 
			in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our 
			greatest challenges in the future.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll need the 
			knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math 
			to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy 
			technologies and protect our environment. You'll need the insights 
			and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social studies 
			to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and 
			make our nation more fair and more free. You'll need the creativity 
			and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies 
			that will create new jobs and boost our economy.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need every single one 
			of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect so 
			you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems. If you 
			don't do that -- if you quit on school -- you're not just quitting 
			on yourself, you're quitting on your country.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know it's not 
			always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have 
			challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on 
			your schoolwork.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I get it. I know what 
			it's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I 
			was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at 
			times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us the things 
			that other kids had. There were times when I missed having a father 
			in my life. There were times when I was lonely and I felt like I 
			didn't fit in.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I wasn't always as 
			focused as I should have been on school, and I did some things I'm 
			not proud of, and I got in more trouble than I should have. And my 
			life could have easily taken a turn for the worse.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I was -- I was 
			lucky. I got a lot of second chances, and I had the opportunity to 
			go to college and law school and follow my dreams. My wife, our 
			First Lady Michelle Obama, she has a similar story. Neither of her 
			parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot of money. 
			But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to 
			the best schools in this country.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of you might not 
			have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life who 
			give you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has 
			lost their job and there's not enough money to go around. Maybe you 
			live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe, or have friends 
			who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But at the end of the 
			day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where you 
			come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home 
			-- none of that is an excuse for neglecting your homework or having 
			a bad attitude in school. That's no excuse for talking back to your 
			teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. There is no 
			excuse for not trying.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where you are right now 
			doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written your 
			destiny for you, because here in America, you write your own 
			destiny. You make your own future.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what young people 
			like you are doing every day, all across America.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Young people like Jazmin 
			Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she first 
			started school. Neither of her parents had gone to college. But she 
			worked hard, earned good grades, and got a scholarship to Brown 
			University -- is now in graduate school, studying public health, on 
			her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm thinking about 
			Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain 
			cancer since he was three. He's had to endure all sorts of 
			treatments and surgeries, one of which affected his memory, so it 
			took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his 
			schoolwork. But he never fell behind. He's headed to college this 
			fall.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then there's 
			Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Even when 
			bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest 
			neighborhoods in the city, she managed to get a job at a local 
			health care center, start a program to keep young people out of 
			gangs, and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go 
			on to college.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And Jazmin, Andoni, and 
			Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They face challenges 
			in their lives just like you do. In some cases they've got it a lot 
			worse off than many of you. But they refused to give up. They chose 
			to take responsibility for their lives, for their education, and set 
			goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why today I'm 
			calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- 
			and do everything you can to meet them. Your goal can be something 
			as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or 
			spending some time each day reading a book. Maybe you'll decide to 
			get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your 
			community. Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being 
			teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look, because 
			you believe, like I do, that all young people deserve a safe 
			environment to study and learn. Maybe you'll decide to take better 
			care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn. And along those 
			lines, by the way, I hope all of you are washing your hands a lot, 
			and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we 
			can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But whatever you resolve 
			to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that sometimes 
			you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successful 
			without any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through 
			rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star. Chances are you're 
			not going to be any of those things.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth is, being 
			successful is hard. You won't love every subject that you study. You 
			won't click with every teacher that you have. Not every homework 
			assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this 
			minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything the first 
			time you try.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's okay. Some of the 
			most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most 
			failures. J.K. Rowling's -- who wrote Harry Potter -- her first 
			Harry Potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally 
			published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball 
			team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during 
			his career. But he once said, &quot;I have failed over and over and over 
			again in my life. And that's why I succeed.&quot;</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These people succeeded 
			because they understood that you can't let your failures define you 
			-- you have to let your failures teach you. You have to let them 
			show you what to do differently the next time. So if you get into 
			trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need 
			to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't 
			mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time 
			studying.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No one's born being good 
			at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You're 
			not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't 
			hit every note the first time you sing a song. You've got to 
			practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might 
			have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You 
			might have to read something a few times before you understand it. 
			You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good 
			enough to hand in.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Don't be afraid to ask 
			questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do 
			that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a 
			sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when 
			you don't know something, and that then allows you to learn 
			something new. So find an adult that you trust -- a parent, a 
			grandparent or teacher, a coach or a counselor -- and ask them to 
			help you stay on track to meet your goals.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And even when you're 
			struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other 
			people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because 
			when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The story of America 
			isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people 
			who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much 
			to do anything less than their best.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's the story of 
			students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a 
			revolution and they founded this nation. Young people. Students who 
			sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a Depression and won a 
			world war; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon. 
			Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Google and 
			Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each 
			other.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I want to ask 
			all of you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems are 
			you going to solve? What discoveries will you make? What will a 
			President who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all 
			of you did for this country?</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, your families, your 
			teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you have 
			the education you need to answer these questions. I'm working hard 
			to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment 
			and the computers you need to learn. But you've got to do your part, 
			too. So I expect all of you to get serious this year. I expect you 
			to put your best effort into everything you do. I expect great 
			things from each of you. So don't let us down. Don't let your family 
			down or your country down. Most of all, don't let yourself down. 
			Make us all proud.</font></div>
		<div class="legacy-para">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
			everybody.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God bless you. God bless America.</font><p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></div>
