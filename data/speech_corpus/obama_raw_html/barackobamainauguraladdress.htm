transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="1" face="Arial">[Chief Justice John G. 
		Roberts administers the Oath of Office]</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I, Barack Hussein Obama, do 
		solemnly swear that I will execute the office of the 
		President of the United States faithfully</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000" /p><sup>1</sup></font><i><font size="2" face="Arial">, and will to the best of my ability, 
		preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, so 
			help me God.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">My fellow citizens:</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I stand here today humbled 
		by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful 
		of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his 
		service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has 
		shown throughout this transition. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Forty-four Americans have 
		now taken the presidential Oath. The words have been spoken during 
		rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so 
		often the Oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At 
		these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or 
		vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained 
		faithful to the ideals of our forebearers [sic], and true to our founding 
		documents.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it has been. So it must 
		be with this generation of Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That we are in the midst 
		of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a 
		far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly 
		weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of 
		some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare 
		the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses 
		shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and 
		each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen 
		our adversaries and threaten our planet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the indicators 
		of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable, but no less 
		profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear 
		that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must 
		lower its sights. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today I say to you that 
		the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. 
		They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, 
		America: They will be met.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On this day, we gather 
		because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict 
		and discord.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On this day, we come to 
		proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the 
		recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled 
		our politics. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We remain a young nation, 
		but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to &quot;set aside childish 
		things.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" /p><sup><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000" size="1">2</font></sup></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 
		The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better 
		history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on 
		from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, 
		all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of 
		happiness.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In reaffirming the 
		greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. 
		It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or 
		settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for 
		those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches 
		and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of 
		things -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their 
		labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity 
		and freedom.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For us, they packed up 
		their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a 
		new life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For us, they toiled in 
		sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed 
		the hard earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For us, they fought and 
		died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Time and again these men 
		and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw 
		so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the 
		sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of 
		birth or wealth or faction.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the journey we 
		continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. 
		Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our 
		minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than 
		they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains 
		undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow 
		interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely 
		passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, 
		and begin again the work of remaking America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For everywhere we look, 
		there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, 
		bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to 
		lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, 
		the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us 
		together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield 
		technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. 
		We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and 
		run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and 
		universities to meet the demands of a new age.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All this we can do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All this we will do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there are some who 
		question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system 
		cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they 
		have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and 
		women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and 
		necessity to courage.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What the cynics fail to 
		understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale 
		political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. 
		The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or 
		too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs 
		at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. 
		Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is 
		no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars 
		will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do 
		our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the 
		vital trust between a people and their government.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor is the question before 
		us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate 
		wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us 
		that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control. The 
		nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The 
		success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our 
		Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the 
		ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of 
		charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for our common defense, 
		we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our 
		Founding Fathers -- Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can 
		scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the 
		rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those 
		ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for 
		expedience'[s] sake. And so to all the other peoples and governments who 
		are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village 
		where my father was born: Know that America is a friend of each nation 
		and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity. 
		And we are ready to lead once more. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recall that earlier 
		generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and 
		tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They 
		understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle 
		us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through 
		its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, 
		the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and 
		restraint.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are the keepers of this 
		legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new 
		threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and 
		understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq 
		to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old 
		friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear 
		threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not 
		apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for 
		those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering 
		innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be 
		broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For we know that our 
		patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of 
		Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers. We are 
		shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this 
		Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and 
		segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more 
		united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday 
		pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world 
		grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America 
		must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To the Muslim world, we 
		seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To 
		those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their 
		society's ills on the West -- know that your people will judge you on 
		what you can build, not what you destroy. To those -- To those who cling 
		to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, 
		know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend 
		a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To the people of poor 
		nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and 
		let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. 
		And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can 
		no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor 
		can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the 
		world has changed, and we must change with it.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamafirstinauguraladdressmain3.jpg" width="388" height="217"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we consider the road 
		that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave 
		Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant 
		mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who 
		lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only 
		because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody 
		the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something 
		greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment -- a moment that will 
		define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us 
		all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For as much as government 
		can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the 
		American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to 
		take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers 
		who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which 
		sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to 
		storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to 
		nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our challenges may be new. 
		The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values 
		upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and 
		fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these 
		things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of 
		progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to 
		these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility 
		-- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to 
		ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly 
		accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is 
		nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than 
		giving our all to a difficult task.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		This is the price and the 
		promise of citizenship.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the source of our 
		confidence -- the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain 
		destiny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the meaning of our 
		liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race 
		and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, 
		and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been 
		served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most 
		sacred Oath.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let us mark this day 
		with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the 
		year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of 
		patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The 
		Capitol was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained 
		with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in 
		doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the 
		people:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let it be told to 
			the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but 
			hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, 
			alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America: In the face of 
		our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember 
		these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the 
		icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our 
		children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this 
		journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes 
		fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that 
		great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, God bless you, 
		and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>

		<u>Update 1/21/09</u>: &quot;At 7:35 pm, Roberts administered the oath of 
		office again to Obama in the map room. Robert Gibbs said the Whitehouse 
		counsel, Greg Craig, believes the oath was fine Tuesday, but one word 
		was out of sequence so they did this out of a 'an abundance of caution.' 
		'We decided it was so much fun....' Obama joked while sitting on a

		Roberts donned his black robe. 'Are you ready to take the oath?' Roberts 
		asked. 'I am, and we're going to do it very slowly,' Obama replied. Oath 
		took 25 seconds. After a flawless recitation, Roberts smiled and said,
