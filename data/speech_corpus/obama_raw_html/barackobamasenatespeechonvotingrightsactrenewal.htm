<font size="1" color="#CE0A04" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, I rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to 
express my support for renewal of 
<a href="http://www.crmvet.org/vra/vraren1.htm#vrarenspecial">
<font color="#0000FF">the expiring provisions</font></a> of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965">
<font color="#0000FF">Voting Rights Act of 1965</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank the many people inside and outside Congress 
who have worked so hard over the past year to get us here. We owe a great debt 
of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle. And we owe special thanks 
to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and 
Representative Mel Watt. Without their work and dedication, and the support 
of voting rights advocates across the country, I doubt that this bill would have come 
before us so soon.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank both Chambers and both sides of the aisle, 
as well, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the 
original act 40 years ago. At a time when Americans are frustrated with the 
partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of 
bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success 
of the act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965. 
Look at the registration numbers. Only two years after the passage of the original 
Act, registration numbers for minority voters in some States doubled. Soon 
after, not a single State covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less 
than half of its minority voting age population.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at the influence of African-American elected 
officials at every single level of government. There are African-American 
Members of Congress. Since 2001, our Nation's top diplomat</font><font face="Verdana"><b><sup><font color="#FF0000" size="1">1</font></sup></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been African 
American. In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials come 
from States covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- States like 
Mississippi, and Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But to me, the most striking evidence of our 
progress can be found right across this building in my dear friend Congressman 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_(politician)">
<font color="#0000FF">John Lewis</font></a>, who was on the front lines of the Civil 
Rights Movement, risking 
life and limb for freedom. And on March 7th, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protesters, 
demanding the right to vote, across the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pettus_Bridge">
<font color="#0000FF">Edmund Pettus Bridge</font></a> in Selma, Alabama. 
Now, I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day, not 
only John Lewis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosea_Williams">
<font color="#0000FF">Hosea Williams</font></a>, who led the march, but the hundreds of 
everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it -- Blacks 
and Whites, teenagers, children, teachers, bankers, shopkeepers -- what Dr. King 
called a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And I wonder sometimes -- Where did they find that kind of 
courage? You know, when you're facing row after row of State troopers on horseback, armed 
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)">
<font color="#0000FF">billy clubs</font></a> and tear gas -- when they're 
coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel 
down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the most amazing thing of all is that after that 
day, after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's 
heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and they watched their 
children's innocence literally beaten out of them -- after all that, they went 
back and marched again. They marched again. They crossed the bridge. They 
awakened a nation's conscience. And not five months later the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 was signed into law. It was reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in 2006 John Lewis, the physical scars of 
those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth 
reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. And he was joined last week by 389 of his 
House colleagues in voting for its passage.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There were some in the House, and there may be some 
in the Senate, who argue that the Act is no longer needed, that the protections 
of section 5's &quot;<a href="http://redistrictingonline.org/Preclearance.html"><font color="#0000FF">preclearance'' requirement</font></a>&quot; -- a requirement that ensures 
certain States are upholding the right to vote -- are targeting the wrong 
States. Unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion. Of the 1100 objections 
issued by the Department of Justice since 1965, 56 [percent] occurred since the 
last reauthorization in 1982. Over half have occurred since 1982. So despite the 
progress these States have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that 
problems still exist.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there are others who would argue that we 
shouldn't renew 
section 203's protection of language minorities. These arguments have been tied 
to debates over immigration and they tend to muddle a noncontroversial issue -- 
protecting the right to vote -- with one of today's most contentious debates. 
But let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you're not a 
voter. And you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen. And while voters, as 
citizens, must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that 
they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors. 
It's not an unreasonable assumption.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A representative of the
<a href="http://www.svrep.org/"><font color="#0000FF">Southwestern Voter 
Registration Project</font></a> is quoted as saying, (quote): </font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Citizens who prefer Spanish 
registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process. They 
also feel they trust the process more when they [fully] understand it.</i></font><font face="Verdana"><b><sup><font color="#FF0000" size="1">2</font></sup></b></font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what we want 
from our voting rights legislation.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our challenges, of course, don't end at 
reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. We have to prevent the problems we've 
seen in recent elections from happening again. We've seen political operatives 
purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible 
ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and 
deceive voters about the time, location, and rules of elections. And unfortunately, 
these efforts have been directed primarily at minority voters -- the disabled, 
low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act">
<font color="#0000FF">The Help America Vote Act</font></a>, or HAVA, was a big 
step in the right direction. But we've got to do more. We need to fully fund HAVA 
if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securing the right to vote 
for every citizen. We need to enforce critical requirements like statewide 
registration databases. We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed 
equitably and equipment actually works. And we need to work on getting more people 
to the polls on election day.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We need to make sure that minority voters are not 
the subject of some deplorable intimidation tactics when they do go to the 
polls.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, in 2004 Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men 
posing as law enforcement. These hired intimidators joked about jail time for 
ballot missteps and followed voters to their cars to record their license 
plates.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">[&quot;]In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on 
bogus Board of Election[s] letterhead, informing voters who registered through 
Democratic and NAACP drives that they could not vote.[&quot;]</font><b><sup><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#FF0000">3</font></sup></b></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the 
&quot;Milwaukee Black Voters League&quot; was circulated in predominantly African-American 
neighborhoods with the following message: &quot;If you've already voted in any 
election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election. &quot;If you violate 
any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get 
taken away from you.&quot;</font><b><font face="Verdana"><sup><font color="#FF0000" size="1">4</font></sup></font></b></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, think about that. We've got a lot more work to 
do. This occasion is a cause for celebration. But it's also an opportunity to 
renew our commitment to voting rights. As Congressman Lewis said last week: 
It's clear that we've come a great distance, but we still have a great 
distance to go.</font><b><font face="Verdana"><sup><font color="#FF0000" size="1">5,</font></sup></font><sup><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">6 </font>
</sup></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting 
Rights Act. Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in 
ensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote but have the right 
to have their vote counted.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And those of us concerned about protecting those rights 
can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill. We need 
to take advantage of this rare, united front and continue to fight to ensure 
unimpeded access to the polls of all Americans. In other words, we need to take 
the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this 
country.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr. 
King spoke, and he told a gathering of organizers and activists and community 
members -- he said that they should not despair because &quot;<a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/article/our_god_is_marching_on/"><font color="#0000FF">the arc of the moral universe is 
long, but it bends toward justice</font></a>.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The arc of the moral universe is long, but it 
bends toward justice. That's because of the work that each of us do that it 
bends toward justice. It's because of people like John Lewis and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Lou_Hamer"><font color="#0000FF">
Fannie Lou Hamer</font></a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coretta_Scott_King"><font color="#0000FF">
Coretta Scott King</font></a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks"><font color="#0000FF">Rosa 
Parks</font></a> -- all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand -- that we are 
beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I stand here today. I would not be in 
the United States Senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and 
grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc 
in the direction of justice.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I hope we continue to see that spirit live on not 
just during this debate but throughout all our work here in the Senate.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.</font></p>
