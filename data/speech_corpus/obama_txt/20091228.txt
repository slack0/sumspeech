Northwest Airlines Flight 253 Terrorist Incident

Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take just a few minutes to update the 
American people on the attempted terrorist attack that occurred on 
Christmas Day and the steps we're taking to ensure the safety and security 
of the country.

The investigation's ongoing. And I spoke again this morning with Attorney 
General Eric Holder, the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, 
and my counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, John Brennan. I 
asked them to keep -- continue monitoring the situation to keep the 
American people and members of Congress informed.

Now, here's what we know so far: On Christmas Day, Northwest Airlines 
Flight 253  
was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. As the plane made its 
final approach to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly tried 
to ignite an explosive device on his body, setting off a fire. Thanks to 
the quick and heroic actions of passengers and crew, the suspect was 
immediately subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane landed safely. The 
suspect is now in custody and has been charged with attempting to destroy 
an aircraft
 . And a 
full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, 
and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them 
accountable.

Now, this was a serious reminder of the dangers that we face and the nature 
of those who threaten our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in bringing 
down that plane, it could have killed nearly 300 passengers and crew, 
innocent civilians preparing to celebrate the holidays with their families 
and friends. The American people should be assured that we are doing 
everything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during 
this busy holiday season.

Since I was first notified of this incident, I've ordered the following 
actions to be taken to protect the American people and to secure air 
travel.

First, I directed that we take immediate steps to ensure the safety of the 
traveling public. We made sure that all flights still in the air were 
secure and could land safely. We immediately enhanced screening and 
security procedures for all flights, domestic and international. We added 
federal air marshals to flights entering and leaving the United States. And 
we're working closely in this country, federal, state and local law 
enforcement, with our international partners.

Second, I've ordered two important reviews, because it's absolutely 
critical that we learn from this incident and take the necessary measures 
to prevent future acts of terrorism.

The first review involves our watch list system, which our government has 
had in place for many years to identify known and suspected terrorists so 
that we can prevent their entry into the United States. Apparently the 
suspect in the Christmas incident was in this system, but not on a watch 
list, such as the so-called no-fly list. So I have ordered a thorough 
review, not only of how information related to the subject was handled, but 
of the overall watch list system and how it can be strengthened.

The second review will examine all screening policies, technologies, and 
procedures related to air travel. We need to determine just how the suspect 
was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what 
additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks.

Third, I've directed my national security team
 to keep up the pressure on those 
who would attack our country. We do not yet have all the answers about this 
latest attempt, but those who would slaughter innocent men, women, and 
children must know that the United States will more -- do more than simply 
strengthen our defenses. We will continue to use every element of our 
national power to disrupt, to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists 
who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or 
Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the U.S. 
homeland.

Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. 
Those plotting against us seek not only to undermine our security, but also 
the open society and the values that we cherish as Americans. This 
incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert 
and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist.

As a nation, we will do everything in our power to protect our country. As 
Americans, we will never give in to fear or division. We will be guided by 
our hopes, our unity, and our deeply held values.

That's who we are as Americans

That's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they 
spend the holidays in harm's way.

And we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in 
the new year and beyond.

On the Violent Suppression in Iran

Before I leave, let me also briefly address the events that have taken 
place over the last few days in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United 
States joins with the international community in strongly condemning the 
violent and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian citizens, which has 
apparently resulted in detentions, injuries, and even death.

For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise 
their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met 
with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days. 
And each time that has happened, the world has watched with deep admiration 
for the courage and the conviction of the Iranian people
 who are part of Iran's great and enduring 
civilization.

What's taking place within Iran is not about the United States or any other 
country. It's about the Iranian people and their aspirations for justice 
and a better life for themselves. And the decision of Iran's leaders to 
govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making those 
aspirations go away.

As I said in Oslo  , it's telling when 
governments fear the aspirations [of] their own people more than the power 
of any other nation.

Along with all free nations, the United States stands with those who seek 
their universal rights  . We call 
upon the Iranian government to abide by the international obligations that 
it has to respect the rights of its own people.

We call for the immediate release of all who have been unjustly detained 
within Iran.

We will continue to bear witness to the extraordinary events that are 
taking place there. And I'm confident that history will be on the side of 
those who seek justice.

Thank you very much, everybody. And happy New Year.
