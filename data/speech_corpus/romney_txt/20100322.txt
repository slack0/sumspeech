A Campaign Begins Today
By Mitt Romney

America has just witnessed an unconscionable abuse of power. President 
Obama has betrayed his oath to the nation — rather than bringing us 
together, ushering in a new kind of politics, and rising above raw 
partisanship, he has succumbed to the lowest denominator of incumbent 
power: justifying the means by extolling the ends. He promised better; we 
deserved better.

He calls his accomplishment “historic” — in this he is correct, although 
not for the reason he intends. Rather, it is an historic usurpation of the 
legislative process — he unleashed the nuclear option, enlisted not a 
single Republican vote in either chamber, bribed reluctant members of his 
own party, paid-off his union backers, scapegoated insurers, and justified 
his act with patently fraudulent accounting. What Barack Obama has ushered 
into the American political landscape is not good for our country; in the 
words of an ancient maxim, “what starts twisted, ends twisted.”

His health-care bill is unhealthy for America. It raises taxes, slashes the 
more private side of Medicare, installs price controls, and puts a new 
federal bureaucracy in charge of health care. It will create a new 
entitlement even as the ones we already have are bankrupt. For these 
reasons and more, the act should be repealed. That campaign begins today.
