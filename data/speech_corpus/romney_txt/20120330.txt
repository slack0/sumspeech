In 222 days, something pretty extraordinary is going to happen in the 
country. We’ll have an election. Across this country, millions and millions 
of Americans will be able to do something that is really quite amazing: 
They will choose not only a President, but an entire House of 
Representatives and a third of the US Senate.

The entire world will be watching us. And by around midnight on November 
6th, maybe a little earlier or a little later, we’ll know the results of 
millions of Americans exercising their right to vote and in doing so, 
making a choice so profound that it is very difficult for any of us to 
grasp.

No one can predict the crisis the next President will confront nor what the 
world will look like at the end of the next President’s term. In a world in 
which the economies of Athens, Wisconsin and Athens, Greece are connected, 
every decision becomes infinitely more complex.

But I believe Americans face a fundamental choice in this election, a 
decision that is much more important than the candidates or the political 
parties. We should understand that we are selecting not just who should 
guide us but a choice between two distinct paths and destinies for our 
nation.

In the days and months ahead, we should ask ourselves some very fundamental 
questions about who we are as a nation and who we are becoming. What does 
it mean to be an American in 2012? What will it mean in 2016 and beyond? 
Are we keeping faith with the great legacy – and trust – that has been 
handed to us by previous generations? And what America will we leave the 
next generation?

This campaign will produce a deafening cacophony of charges and counter 
charges and by November 6th, most Americans will probably be afraid to turn 
on their TV. So now, in this quiet before the storm, let’s start with some 
basic facts about which there can be no debate.

Since Barack Obama became President, over 800,000 Americans have lost their 
jobs.

Millions of Americans spent longer looking for a job than ever before. 
Long-term unemployment is the worst since the Great Depression.

Over 46 million Americans are now living in poverty, more than ever before 
in our nation’s history. In households with single moms, over 30% are 
living in poverty.

Forty-six and a half million Americans are now on food stamps, another 
record.

2.8 million homes have been foreclosed on.

New business startups are at the lowest level in 30 years.

Over 2,000 Chrysler and GM dealerships have closed and 22 automobile 
manufacturing plants have been shuttered or idled.

Our yearly budget deficits are soaring and our national debt now stands at 
an all-time high. Barack Obama presided over the first trillion-dollar 
deficit in American history. And he has repeated this dreadful distinction 
for each year he has been in office.

For the first time since World War II, our national debt is greater than 
the size of our entire economy. Each American’s share of the national debt 
stands at $50,000.

President Obama did not cause the recession, but he most certainly failed 
to lead the recovery. His stimulus protected the government, not the 
people. It was promised to hold unemployment below eight percent. It did 
not. Barack Obama’s stimulus was as ineffective as it was expensive.

His Obamacare didn’t help create jobs either. It discouraged small 
businesses and health companies from hiring new workers. And Dodd-Frank 
hurt the community banks that provide loans to small businesses. But the 
“Too Big To Fail” banks are even bigger today.

He failed to deliver on jobs, but on his goal to raise energy prices, he 
sure came through. All in all, President Obama prolonged the recession and 
slowed the recovery. His economic strategy is a bust.

These troubling facts are President’s Obama’s legacy and now our shared 
history. As much as we would like to, we can’t undo what has happened these 
past years. The families who have lost their homes, the factories that have 
closed, the students who had to drop out of college and those who never 
could make it in the door, all those missed chances and lost opportunities 
can’t be regained.

And that’s why it is important to understand one astonishing fact about 
this election: President Obama thinks he’s doing a good job. No, I’m not 
kidding. He actually thinks he’s doing a great job. An historically great 
job. According to the President, only Lincoln, FDR and Lyndon Johnson have 
accomplished more. And no, he didn’t say that on Saturday Night Live.

How can this be? Is it that the President is just so disconnected from what 
is happening across America that he doesn’t grasp the real consequences of 
his failures?

That answer is easy. The answer is yes. Of course. This is a President who 
was elected not on the strength of a compelling record but a compelling 
personality and story. There was much about the campaign of Barack Obama 
that appealed to many Americans. And though the reality has failed the hope 
and change he promised, he remains surrounded by true believers who attack 
anyone who challenges their power. And, as we see each day, they will fight 
even more fiercely to hold on to that power.

All of this is to be expected. That power loves power and never lets go 
easily is hardly new. And that a White House has lost touch, well, I think 
we’ve seen that once or twice before.

But we should also remember that candidate Barack Obama pledged that he 
wanted to “transform this nation.” And, unfortunately, that is exactly what 
he has been doing. And that is one more reason why this election is so 
critical.

The choice before us could not be more profound. Barack Obama and I have 
fundamentally different visions for America.

He has spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new 
Government-Centered Society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding 
the foundation of our Opportunity Society, led by free people and free 
enterprises.

Our different visions for America are the product of our values and our 
life experiences.

Barack Obama once said that his work as a community organizer motivated him 
to help “communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.” His desire 
to help others could not be more admirable but it’s clear that he saw free 
enterprise as the villain and not the solution.

The only real solution to help those communities devastated by lost jobs is 
more jobs. Barack Obama seems never to have understood the basic point that 
a plant closes when a business loses money.

So when this President attacks businesses for making money, and when his 
policies make it more difficult for businesses to make money, he is also 
attacking the very communities he wanted to help. That’s how it works in 
America. Or at least that’s how it works when America is working.

But under Barack Obama, America hasn’t been working. The ironic tragedy is 
that the community organizer who wanted to help those hurt by a plant 
closing became the President on whose watch more jobs were lost than any 
time since the Great Depression.

Instead of doing everything possible to promote the power of the free 
enterprise system to create jobs and get us out of this economic crisis, 
Barack Obama has promoted the power of government. The results have been 
predictably dismal, but he has “transformed” us, as he likes to say, closer 
to his vision of a Government-Centered Society.

In Barack Obama’s Government-Centered Society, the government must do more 
because the economy is doomed to do less. When you attack business and 
vilify success, you will have less business and less success. And then, of 
course the debate becomes about how much to extend unemployment insurance 
because you have guaranteed there will be millions more unemployed.

In Barack Obama’s Government-Centered Society, government naturally 
allocates the rewards. Tax breaks are bestowed not to make us more 
productive or to grow a stronger economy but to reshape the society into 
what is currently fashionable and politically correct. Because business is 
inherently suspect, government regulators who know better must oversee and 
direct business decision-making.

In Barack Obama’s Government-Centered Society, tax increases become not 
only a necessity but also a desired tool for social justice. In that world 
of shrinking means, there’s a finite amount of money, and as someone once 
famously said, you need taxes to spread the wealth around.

In Barack Obama’s Government-Centered Society, government spending will 
always increase because there’s no reason to stop it. There’s always 
someone who is entitled to something more, and who will vote for anyone who 
will give them something more.

In a Government-Centered Society, government dispenses the benefits, 
borrows what it can’t take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the 
economy.

Today, government at all levels consumes 38 percent of the total economy or 
G.D.P. If Obamacare is allowed to stand, government will directly control 
almost half of the American economy. And through the increasing controls 
government has imposed on industries like energy and financial services, 
and automobiles, it will indirectly or directly control well over half of 
our total economy.

One must ask whether we will still be a free enterprise nation and whether 
we will still have economic freedom. America is on the cusp of having a 
government-run economy. President Obama is transforming America into 
something very different than the land of the free and the land of 
opportunity.

We know where that transformation leads. There are other nations that have 
chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and 
stagnant wages. Sound familiar?

I don’t want to transform America; I want to restore the values of economic 
freedom, opportunity, and small government that have made this nation the 
leader it is.

Freedom and opportunity have made America the most powerful economy in the 
world. They are the foundation of a nation with full employment, rising 
wages, and fiscal stability. The best thing we can do for the economic 
well-being of the people of America is not to grow government, it is to 
restore freedom and opportunity. It is opportunity that has always driven 
America and defined us as Americans.

My grandfather was in the construction business and he never really made it 
himself. But he helped convince my dad that he could accomplish anything he 
set his mind to. My dad didn’t have the chance to finish college and he 
apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. Based on that excellent 
training, he went on to turn around a great car company and later became 
governor of Michigan.

My father made the most of opportunities that came before him, and by the 
time I came along – I was the fourth of four brothers and sisters – I had 
the chance to get the education my dad couldn’t.

I loved cars and was tempted to stay in Michigan and go into the car 
business but I knew I would always wonder if any success I had was due to 
my father. So when I got out of business school, I stayed in Massachusetts 
and got an entry-level job with the best company that would hire me. More 
importantly, I was married and on the way to having five sons.

Over the next 25 years, my business career had many ups and downs, great 
successes, definite failures, but each step of the way I learned more about 
the transforming power of our great free enterprise system.

I’m not naïve enough to believe that free enterprise is the solution to all 
of our problems – nor am I naïve enough to doubt that it is one of the 
greatest forces of good this world has ever known.

Free enterprise has done more to lift people out of poverty, to help build 
a strong middle class, to help educate our kids, to make our lives better, 
than all of the government programs put together.

If we become one of those societies that attacks success, one outcome is 
certain – there will be a lot less success.

That’s not who we are. The promise of America has always been that if you 
worked hard, and took some risks, that there was the opportunity to build a 
better life for your family and for the next generation. It’s not 
government’s role to guarantee that every one of us will achieve the 
success we seek.

This nation was founded on the principle that we have a God-given right to 
pursue happiness. It is the pursuit that is guaranteed, not the result. It 
is the opportunity that is guaranteed, not the outcome. We are an 
Opportunity Nation.

Over the centuries, men and women pursuing happiness in their own unique 
ways have made ours the leading economy in the world, and as we look to the 
future, I am absolutely confident that the principles that created our 
strength are the very ones that will preserve it.

This means that government must be smaller and have strict limits placed on 
its power. Obamacare violates both principles. I will repeal it.

Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing 
nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That’s why I will 
cut marginal tax rates across the board.

Regulations are necessary, but they must be continuously updated, 
streamlined, and modernized. Regulators should see part of their job as 
protecting economic freedom, promoting enterprise, and fostering job 
creation.

Workers should have the right to form unions, but unions should not be 
forced upon them. And unions should not have the power to take money out of 
their members’ paychecks to buy the support of politicians favored by the 
union bosses.

In short, government must make America the best place in the world for 
entrepreneurs, innovators, small business and big business – for job 
creators of all kinds. Business is not the enemy. It is the friend of jobs, 
of rising wages, and of the revenues government needs to care for the poor 
and the elderly, and to provide for the national defense.

Out-of-touch liberals like Barack Obama say they want a strong economy, but 
they really don’t like businesses very much. But the economy is simply the 
product of all the nations’ businesses added together. So it’s like saying 
you love omelettes but don’t like eggs.

To build a strong economy that provides good jobs and rising wages and that 
reduces poverty, we need to build successful businesses of every kind 
imaginable. And President Obama has been attacking successful businesses of 
every kind imaginable.

Apple Computer and Microsoft weren’t started to save the world and neither 
were General Motors or Alcoa. Nor were some of the companies I helped start 
like Staples or The Sports Authority. All of these great American 
enterprises were started because innovators had great ideas and great 
ambitions. They became great commercial ventures, which is another way of 
saying they made a lot of money. Not just for a few people but for many 
people. They helped people buy homes, go to school, retire, start other 
companies.

We have always been the country where dreamers build dreams and where one 
dream helps launch another. And if those dreamers are rewarded with 
prosperity, we view that as a reason others would be encouraged to dream 
big as well.

We have to understand that today much of the world is hungry for the big 
dreamers with big ideas. America must fight to grow these dreamers and 
innovators, and to attract those from other lands.

My father had a favorite saying: “Nothing is as vulnerable as entrenched 
success.” Today, because America has been so successful for so long, we 
seem to have forgotten what brought us here. America has become vulnerable 
to new competition, to looming debt, and to those who would substitute more 
government power for more freedom. We have made some bad choices and 
ignored the mounting threats.

But if the hill is a little steeper before us, we have always been a nation 
of big steppers.

In this last year, I have been all over this country, from student union 
cafeterias to kitchen tables, from factory breakrooms to boardrooms, and 
I’ve heard frustration and anger but rarely hopelessness. Many Americans 
have given up on this President but they haven’t ever thought about giving 
up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.

We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it. 
We will do it because we believe in America.

This Tuesday, join me. Join me in the next step toward that destination of 
November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know 
that the Promise of America has been kept. The dreamers can dream a little 
bigger, the help wanted signs can be dusted off, and we can start again.

And this time we’ll get it right. We’ll stop the days of apologizing for 
success at home and never again apologize for America abroad. Together 
we’ll build the greatest America we have ever known, where prosperity is 
grown and shared, not limited and divided, an America that guarantees that 
ours is the door that innovation and greatness always knocks on first.

There was a time – not so long ago – when each of us could walk a little 
taller and stand a little straighter because we had a gift that no one else 
in the world shared. We were Americans. That meant something different to 
each of us but it meant something special to all of us. We knew it without 
question. And so did the world.

Those days are coming back. That’s our destiny. Join me. Walk together this 
Tuesday. And take another step every day until November 6th.

We believe in America. We believe in ourselves. Our greatest days are still 
ahead. We are, after all, Americans!

God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
